Methane production kinetics of pretreated slaughterhouse wastewater,"The aim of this work was to analyze the methane production kinetics of pretreated slaughterhouse wastewater through biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests, where the volumetric ratio and, consequently, the substrate to inoculum ratio (SIR) were varied. The thermal pretreatment was autoclaving (60 min at 120 degrees C/1.2 atm), and two phases appeared: liquid (clarified) and semisolid. Half of this semisolid also underwent a mechanical pretreatment (1 min with a cell disruptor). Afterward, BMP tests were carried out in serological bottles under five different volumetric ratios (1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1 and 5:1), with RSWW, semisolid and semisolid after mechanical pretreatment as substrates. The volume of clarified liquid obtained after autoclaving was 84.5% of the RSWW, with removal percentages of COD, solids, proteins, and ammonium ranging from 50% to 89%, while the volume of the semisolid was only 4.35% of the RSWW, with the major portion of the pollutants concentrated in it. In the BMP tests, the methane generation was approximately fifteen times higher and lasted two times longer with semisolid as the substrate than that when using RSWW. The optimal volumetric ratio was 4:1 (SIR 5.67). The methane kinetics also changed: in RSWW, the kinetics followed the typical sigmoidal curve, whereas in semisolid, the kinetics were complex, showing a stepped curve. The cumulative methane production fit well to the Gompertz, Richards, logistic, Luedeking-Piret and modified first-order rate models, although none of them accurately described the second inflection point found at the end of the inhibited steady-state phase.","Hernandez-Fydrych, VC; Benitez-Olivares, G; Meraz-Rodriguez, MA; Salazar-Pelaez, ML; Fajardo-Ortiz, MC",Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Physical pretreatment,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2019.105385,Physical,thermal,autoclave,animal byproduct,clarified slaughterhouse,,0.3,0.2,,,,,,
Effect of hydrothermal pretreatment on Miscanthus anaerobic digestion,"Miscanthus is a promising source of bioenergy with high lignocellulose content. This paper studied the effect of hydrothermal pretreatment on Miscanthus biogas production. Different pretreatment temperature from 125 to 200 degrees C was tested. After pretreatment, hemicellulose was partially removed and this led to a change in cellulose accessibility. Enzymatic hydrolysis was used to examine the digestibility of different samples. There was no obvious enhancement in low temperature (125 and 150 degrees C) conditions. According to the results, 200 degrees C hydrothermal pretreatment was the optimal condition saving 50% on the digestion time and increasing glucose production 13.2 times compared with the raw material. Although the cellulose crystallinity increased after the pretreatment, its effect on biogas production and enzymatic hydrolysis was limited.

Thermal pretreatment of algae for anaerobic digestion,"The objective of this work was to determine the benefit of thermal pretreatment on biogas yield from microalgae-fed anaerobic digester mesocosms. Replicate Nanochloropsis oculata cultures were heated for 4 h at 30, 60, and 90 degrees C, as well as at a constant temperature of 90 degrees C for 1, 3.5, and 12 h. Net biogas production increased from 0.28 L biogas/g volatile solids added (VSa) for the control to 0.39 L biogas/g VSa (p < 0.01) when heated at 90 degrees C, but there was no improvement at 30 or 60 degrees C. Increased biogas production correlated with increased soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD). Net biogas production increased as a function of heating time, from 0.32 L biogas/g VSa for the control, to 0.41, 0.43, and 0.44 L biogas/g VSa (p < 0.05 for all combinations vs. control) when preheated at 90 degrees C for 1, 3.5, and 12 h, respectively. However, despite enhanced biogas production the energy balance is negative for thermal pretreatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Biomethane enhancement from corn straw using anaerobic digestion by-products as pretreatment agents: A highly effective and green strategy,"The development of biogas projects feed by lignocellulosic biomass has been constrained by the high cost of pre- and post-treatment. In this study, a novel strategy for pretreatment by using two by-products, i.e., CO2 and liquid digestate (LD), generated from anaerobic digestion (AD) was developed to overcome these shortcomings. Results showed that corn straw pretreated in LD pressurized under 1 Mpa CO2 at 55 degrees C resulted in increased glucose and xylose contents and a 9.80% decrease in cellulose crystallinity. After 45 days of AD conversion, the methane yield increased by 50.97% compared with untreated straw. However, pretreatment in LD pressurized under 1 Mpa CO2 at 170 degrees C produced 5- hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural, which led to a decrease in methane production from the straw in the subsequent AD conversion. The alteration of the microbial community in the pretreated slurry at 55 degrees C was another potential contributor to the enhanced performance of AD.","Ma, SS; Wang, HL; Wang, BS; Gu, XH; Zhu, WB",Biomass pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Biomethane; Lignocellulose,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.126177,Physical,thermal,,lignocellulose,corn,straw,93,81,42,1.13,37,,,

Effects of Pretreatment and Ratio of Solid Sago Waste to Rumen on Biogas Production through Solid-State Anaerobic Digestion,"Solid sago waste is a potential source of producing renewable energy in the form of biogas. This study investigated the effects of solid sago waste particle size, biological pretreatment using a microbial consortium of lignocelluloses, pretreatment with NaOH, and the ratio between solid sago waste and cow rumen based on the biogas production rate. Several variations of these conditions were used to achieve this. The anaerobic digestion process was conducted over two months at 30.42 degrees C +/- 0.05 degrees C, and the biogas production rate was measured every two days. The 1:1 ratio showed better results compared to the 2:1, because it allows the bacteria to achieve metabolic balance. The highest cumulative biogas production (27.91 mL/g TS) was generated when the sago waste underwent milling (+/- 1 mm), pretreatment with 4% NaOH g/g TS, and treatment with microbial consortium 5% v/v at a 1:1 ratio of solid sago waste to the rumen.","Sumardiono, S; Adisukmo, G; Hanif, M; Budiyono, B; Cahyono, H",anaerobic digestion; biogas; pretreatment; solid-state anaerobic digestion method; solid sago waste,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13137491,Physical,mechanical desintegration,milling,lignocellulose,sago,waste,,,,,,,,

"Low-heat, mild alkaline pretreatment of switchgrass for anaerobic digestion","This study examines the effectiveness of alkaline pretreatment under mild heat conditions (100 degrees C or 212 degrees F) on the anaerobic co-digestion of switchgrass. The effects of alkaline concentration, types of alkaline, heating time and rinsing were evaluated. In addition to batch studies, continuous-feed studies were performed in triplicate to identify potential digester operational problems caused by switchgrass co-digestion while accounting for uncertainty due to digester variability. Few studies have examined anaerobic digestion of switchgrass or the effects of mild heating to enhance alkaline pretreatment prior to biomass digestion. Results indicate that pretreatment can significantly enhance digestion of coarse-ground ( 0.78cm particle size) switchgrass. Energy conversion efficiency as high as 63% was observed, and was comparable or superior to fine-grinding as a pretreatment method. The optimal NaOH concentration was found to be 5.5% (wt/wt alkaline/biomass) with a 91.7% moisture level. No evidence of operational problems such as solids build-up, poor mixing, or floating materials were observed. These results suggest the use of waste heat from a generator could reduce the concentration of alkaline required to adequately pretreat lignocellulosic feedstock prior to anaerobic digestion.","Jin, G; Bierma, T; Walker, PM",Anaerobic digestion; alkaline pretreatment; biogas; switchgrass; NaOH,2014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2014.859453,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,lignocellulose,switchgrass,grass,93,,,,,,,

Production of biogas (methane and hydrogen) from anaerobic digestion of hemicellulosic hydrolysate generated in the oxidative pretreatment of coffee husks,"Ozone pretreatment of coffee husks (CH) was evaluated to generate hydrolysates for biogas production and to preserve cellulose of the solid phase for 2G ethanol production. Pretreatment variables included liquid-to-solid ratio (LSR), pH and specific applied ozone load (SAOL). Considering single-stage anaerobic digestion (AD), the highest methane production (36 NmL CH4/g CH) was achieved with the hydrolysate generated in the experiment using LSR 10 mL/g, pH 11 and SAOL 18.5 mg O-3/g CH, leading to 0.064 kJ/g CH energy recovery. Due to the presence of toxic compounds in the hydrolysate, the addition of powdered activated carbon (4 g/L) to the reactor enhanced biogas production, leading to 86 NmL CH4/g CH yield and 0.58 kJ/g CH energy recovery. When two-stage AD was applied, methane production resulted in 49 NmL CH4/g CH, with additional 19 NmL H-2/g CH production, resulting in a net 0.26 kJ/g CH energy recovery.","dos Santos, LC; Adarme, OFH; Baeta, BEL; Gurgel, LVA; de Aquino, SF",Coffee husks; Pretreatment; Ozonolysis; Biogas; Anaerobic digestion,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.05.037,Chemical,oxidizer,ozone,lignocellulose,coffea,husk,,,,,,,,
Valorization of biogas production through disintegration of waste activated sludge using visible light ZnO-ZnS/Ag2O-Ag2S photocatalyst,"The key requirements for accelerating the anaerobic digestion process and clean energy production involve the disintegration of the recalcitrant structure of waste activated sludge and transforming it into soluble organic components for microbial degradation. Herein, the visible light-active ZnO-ZnS/Ag2Ag2S nanocatalyst was used for the photocatalytic solubilization of sludge to improve methane production through anaerobic digestion. The photocatalysis released the soluble substances in sludge slurry, in which soluble chemical oxygen demand was increased from 410 to 3892 mg L-1 after 6 h. The volatile solids content was only decreased by 13.1%, which indicated that a short period of pretreatment could avoid the mineralization of organic matter. Methane production was improved by 54% in photocatalytic pretreated sludge, where the cumulative methane production was up to 0.6985 mL g(-1) of VS compared with 0.4533 mL g(-1) of VS in untreated sludge. Similarly, a higher organic matter removal efficiency of 54% was achieved due to the increased bioavailability of organic compounds under the influence of the pre-solubilization of sludge during photocatalysis. Moreover, photocatalysis reduced the start-up time for methanogenesis from 23 to 13 days. Overall, this study determined the significance of visible light-active ZnO-ZnS/Ag2O-Ag2S photocatalysis for sludge treatment and cleaner energy production, while providing a useful reference for its industrial applications.

Effect of biological pretreatment of Agropyron elongatum 'BAMAR' on biogas production by anaerobic digestion,"The aim of this work was to analyze the impact of three different moisture contents (MC), at 45% MC, 65% MC, 75% MC, on the degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin during fungi treatment by Flammulina velutipes of Agropyron elongatum 'BAMAR' and on biogas production. The analysis of chemical composition shown that F. velutipes had greater selectivity for lignin biodegradation with the highest hemicellulose and lignin removal at 29.1% and 35.4%, respectively, and lowest cellulose removal (20.48%) at 65% MC. F. velutipes cultivated at 65% MC increased biogas production of 398.07 Ndm(3) kg (1) VS (1), which was 120% higher than the untreated sample. These treatment conditions resulted in 134% more methane yield compared with untreated sample. The results of this study suggested that A. elongatum is a potential biomass for biogas production in agriculture biogas plant and white- rot fungus F. velutipes provides an effective methods for improve biodegradation of A. elongatum.

In view of the key bottlenecks such as low substrate degradation rate and poor productivity of algae waste production process, this study analyzes the combined effect of two metallic and metallic oxide nanoparticles with different substrate pretreatment methods (autoclave, ultrasonic, and microwave methods) to investigate the effect of anaerobic digestion of green algae (Enteromorpha). The results showed that out of the three pretreatment methods, microwave pretreatment and nanoparticles' synergistic effect significantly increases biogas production. The microbial community composition at the phylum level was analyzed. It was observed that the Firmicutes were most abundant across all samples. The relative abundance of Firmicutes for control, Ni NPs + MW, Co NPs + MW, and Fe3O4 NPs + MW groups were 51.78, 70.37, 75.77, and 83.93%, respectively. The second most abundant was of Bacteroidetes that also contributes to hydrogen production. This relatively high abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes promises its potential applications in a hydrogen production facility.

Visible light photocatalytic disintegration of waste activated sludge for enhancing biogas production,"Biogas production using waste activated sludge (WAS) is one of the most demanding technologies for sludge treatment and generating energy in sustainable manner. The present study deals with the photocatalytic pretreatment of WAS using ZnO-ZnS@polyaniline (ZnO-ZnS@PANI) nanocomposite as means for increasing its degradability for improved biogas production by anaerobic digestion (AD). Photo catalysis accelerated the hydrolysis of WAS and increased the sCOD by 6.7 folds after 6 h and transform tCOD into bioavailable sCOD. After the AD of WAS, a removal of organic matter (60.6%) and tCOD (693%) was achieved in photocatalytic pretreated sludge. The biogas production was 1.6 folds higher in photocatalytic sludge with accumulative biogas up to 1645.1 ml L(-1)vs after 45 days compared with the raw sludge (1022.4 ml L(-1)vs). Moreover, the photocatalysis decrease the onset of methanogenesis from 25 to 12 days while achieve the maximum conversion rate of reducing sugars into organic acids at that time. These results suggested that photocatalysis is an efficient pretreatment method and ZnO-ZnS@PANI can degrade sludge efficiently for enhance biogas production in anaerobic digestion process.

Effect of Chemical Coagulation Pretreatment on Anaerobic Digestion of Tannery Wastewater,"Tanning factory is globally considered to be one of the most resource consuming and pollutants producing industries because it requires, for processing leather, large amounts of fresh water, chemical reagents, and energy, and in addition produces wastes, liquid as well solid, rich in organic matter and heavy metals (e.g., chromium). Such characteristics of tannery wastes make their biological treatment promising as well as challenging. This study deals with the effect of coagulation process as a pretreatment method on real tannery wastewater prior to anaerobic digestion (AD), with the aim of removing chromium and thus limiting its inhibitory effect on biological process. Different concentrations (100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1,000 mg/L) of the coagulant FeCl3 were tested, at pH 7.5, with an initial total chromium concentration of 150 mg/L. The efficiency of metal removal was in the range of 0.44-29.38%. Simultaneously, the chemical oxygen demand was reduced by 0.86-28.80%, with the detrimental effect of lowering the total biogas production potential from tannery wastewater. Nevertheless, coagulation pretreatment enhanced the AD process of tannery wastewater, resulting in an increase of the cumulative biogas production by 10% and in a reduction of the digestion time by approximately 25%, in comparison with untreated wastewater. After 37 days of incubation, the maximum specific cumulated volume of biogas produced from the wastewater pretreated with 800 mg/L of FeCl3 was 837 mL/g total volatile solids added with approximately 84% of methane.

TiO2 supported natural zeolites as biogas enhancers through photocatalytic pre-treatment of Miscanthus x giganteous crops,"Miscanthus giganteous is probably the most fast growing and low nutrient bioenergy crop among lignocellulosic feedstocks. Despite its significant content in fermentable sugars, currently Miscanthus biomass is not used for biogas/methane production due to the high-lignin and low moisture content in the winter/spring harvest as well as cellulose crystallinity, which limit access to enzymatic action for all lignocellulosic feedstock. This study identified that a photocatalytic pretreatment prior to anaerobic digestion helps increase the substrate's biodegradability by oxidising the lignin fraction, leading to increased methane yield up to 46% compared to the untreated. A novel photocatalyst was manufactured by reactive magnetron-sputtering deposition of TiO2 particles onto natural zeolite supports, which provided important trace elements for the anaerobic digestion process and retained a large surface area that acted as biofilm to boost growth of the microbial community. A load of 2% w/w catalyst in the bioreactor after 3 h of photocatalytic treatment led to 220 mL(N) gVS(-1), with a net energy balance that is achieved for the whole process when treating the dispersed phase suspension at concentrations above 10 g m(-3).

Enhancement of anaerobic digestion of grass by pretreatment with imidazolium-based ionic liquids,"In this work, the toxicity of imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs) and the enhancement of high-solid anaerobic digestion by pretreatment were studied. Compared with [Bmim] Cl, [Bmim] OAc and [Bmim] BF4, [Bmim] PF6 had the highest toxicity. When the mass ratio of [Bmim] PF6 to grass was higher than 1: 10, biogas was not produced within 30 days. The ability to remove lignin and hemicellulose followed the sequence of [Bmim] OAc, [Bmim] Cl, [Bmim] BF4 and [Bmim] PF6. The crystallinity index of grass pretreated with [Bmim] OAc, [Bmim] Cl, [Bmim] BF4 and [Bmim] PF6 reduced by 73.83%, 54.44%, 17.52% and 7.47%, respectively. The pretreatment with ILs enhanced the methane yield of grass by reducing crystallinity and particle size. The grass pretreated with [Bmim] OAc had the highest methane yield, about 221 mL/g volatile solids, due to its good lignin removal ability and relative low toxicity. After 10 times recycling, the cumulative methane yield of grass pretreated by recycled [Bmim] OAc decreased by 11.95%.","Li, W; Xu, G",Ionic liquids; biogas; hydrolysis; anaerobic digestion; pretreatment,2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2016.1238963,Chemical,solvent,ionic liquid imidazolium-based,lignocellulose,Axonopus compressus,grass,,,,,,,,
Mechanical pretreatment of lignocelluloses for enhanced biogas production: Methane yield prediction from biomass structural components,"In this study, mechanical pretreatment was applied to six different lignocelluloses in two different treatment phases and the prediction of their methane yield was done from biomass chemical composition. Physicochemical, proximate and microbial analyses were carried out on both pretreated and untreated biomass using standard methods. Mechanical pretreatments caused the breakdown of structural materials in all the used biomass which was characterized by reduction of the lagging time during anaerobic digestion and the subsequent increase in methane yield up to 22%. The different loading rate of biomass had no effect on the overall methane yield increase. Both single and multiple linear regressions models were used in order to correlate the chemical composition of the biomass with their methane potentials and a fairly high correlation (R-2 = 0.63) was obtained. The study also showed that the pretreatments are economically feasible.

Biogas Production from Waste Microalgal Biomass Obtained from Nutrient Removal of Domestic Wastewater,"In this study, a semi-continuous photobioreactor was operated for the investigation of nutrient removal efficiency of a unialgal culture, Chlorella vulgarAs. Maximum nitrogen and phosphorous removal efficiencies of 99.6 and 91.2 % were achieved in the photobioreactor. The microalgal slurry obtained from the effluent of the photobioreactor was subjected to biochemical methane potential assay, after application of heat, autoclave, and thermochemical pretreatments to improve anaerobic digestibility and biogas production. Evaluation of pretreatment options indicated that heat pretreatment is the most efficient method in terms of enhancing anaerobic digestibility, at the chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading of 19 +/- 0.5 g L-1. This method increased the methane yield by 83.0 %, from 223 to 408 mL CH4 g VS (added) (-1) , compared to untreated microalgal slurry reactor with the same COD value. Among reactors with 35 +/- 1.5 g L-1 initial COD concentration, autoclave-pretreated microalgal slurry was found to yield the highest methane value of 356 mL CH4 g VS (added) (-1) , which was 43.0 % higher than the value observed in the reactor fed with untreated microalgal slurry. The thermochemical pretreatment caused production of inhibitory compounds and resulted in lower biomethane production and COD treatment values, compared to untreated microalgae. Outcomes of this study reveal that coupled micro-algal and anaerobic biotechnology could be a sustainable alternative for integrated nutrient removal and biofuel production applications.","Calicioglu, O; Demirer, GN",Chlorella vulgaris; Photobioreactor; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Pretreatment,2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-016-9546-9,Physical,thermal,""""",autoclave,thermochemical",micro-algae,chlorella,vulgaris,33,28,,,,,,

Effects of Vapothermal Pretreatment on Anaerobic Degradability of Common Reed,"Residual materials from currently unused plant matter are available locally in abundance and serve as a valuable substrate for biogas production via anaerobic digestion. However, in most cases, a pretreatment is necessary to overcome their recalcitrant behavior. Against this background, earlier ground biomass from Phragmites australis, better known as common reed, is pretreated in a vapothermal atmosphere at temperatures between 122 and 178 degrees C and residence times between 18 and 102 min. Herein, the influence of such a pretreatment on the specific biogas and methane yield is aimed to be evaluated. In addition, the main causes for changes in degradability are identified by means of accompanying analytics. It is found that vapothermal pretreatment is able to significantly enhance degradation velocity during anaerobic digestion. However, under severe conditions, the biogas and methane yields decrease, which is traced back to an increase in cellulose crystallinity, inaccessibility of pores due to precipitated reaction products, as well as the formation of inhibiting substances and proportional increase in nondegradable lignin.","Scherzinger, M; Kaltschmitt, M; Thoma, M",anaerobic digestion; biogas; common reeds; vapothermal pretreatments,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ente.202001046,Physical,thermal,steam vapothermal,lignocellulose,Phragmites australis,plant,99,94.7,,,,48,23,12.5
Impact of pretreatment on solid state anaerobic digestion of yard waste for biogas production,"Solid state anaerobic digestion, as a safe and environment-friendly technology to dispose municipal solid wastes, can produce methane and reduce the volume of wastes.

Lime Pretreatment of Miscanthus: Impact on BMP and Batch Dry Co-Digestion with Cattle Manure,"In Europe, the agricultural biogas sector is currently undergoing fast developments, and cattle manure constitutes an important feedstock. Batch dry digester processes with leachate recirculation prove to be particularly interesting for small-scale plants. However, their startup being relatively slow, the process could be facilitated by co-digestion with energy crops. In this study, Miscanthus x giganteus was chosen for its high biomass yields and low input requirements. The carbohydrate accessibility of this lignocellulosic biomass is limited but may be improved with alkali pretreatment. The efficiency of lime (CaO) pretreatment with low water addition on the biochemical methane potential (BMP) of miscanthus was investigated through two experimental designs (CaO concentrations ranged between 2.5 and 17.5% and pretreatment lasted 1, 3, or 5 days). The pretreated miscanthus was then co-digested with cattle manure in dry leach bed reactors. CaO pretreatments led to a 14-37% improvement of miscanthus BMP, and a 67-227% increase in the first-order kinetics constant; a high contact time was shown to favor methane production. According to these results and to industrial requirements, miscanthus was pretreated with 5 and 10% CaO for 5 days, then co-digested with manure in dry leach bed reactors. Nevertheless, the promising results of the BMP tests were not validated. This could be related to the high water absorption capacity of miscanthus.","Thomas, HL; Seira, J; Escudie, R; Carrere, H",anaerobic digestion; biogas; lignocellulosic biomass; alkali pretreatment,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules23071608,Chemical,alkaline,cao,lignocellulose,miscanthus,plant,94,9212,,,,,,
The effect of alkali pretreatment of rice straw for anaerobic digestion,"The anaerobic digestion is an efficient utilization way of crop residues and alkali pretreatment are often used to enhance the degradation. Alkali pretreatment based on Ca(OH)(2) addition of rice straw was studied.The tests of 3 g/l, 9 g/l Ca(OH)(2) addition had an significant effect on enhancing solubilization and rapid acidification, the results were 1521.2 gCOD/l and 935 ml biogas yield of 3 g/l Ca(OH)(2) addition, 1600.7 gCOD/l and 1200 ml biogas yield of 9 g/l Ca(OH)(2) addition, compared to 405.5 gCOD/l and 1162 ml of control(0 g/l Ca(OH)(2) addition). The results also showed that tests of 15 g/l, 21 g/l of Ca(OH)(2) addition were entirely inhibited to biogas yield. The result of the present work implied that although alkali pretreatment to rice straw can significantly enhance solubilization, the inhibition to methane yield was liable to occur.","Ai, P; Wang, YY; Zhang, YL; Li, W; Yan, SP",alkali pretreatment; rice straw; biogas; anaerobic digestion,2012,http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.347-353.2555,Chemical,alkaline,caoh,lignocellulose,rice,straw,87,70,,,,30,,

Integration of subcritical water pretreatment and anaerobic digestion technologies for valorization of acai processing industries residues,"The objective of this work was to study the valorization of residual biomass and wastewater from acai fruit processing to obtain energy products and higher added value from such residues, through the integration between subcritical waterpretreatment and anaerobic digestion technologies. Subcritical watertechnology was performed to pretreat the residual biomass. For this process, the reactorwas feed with 5 g of acai residue and a solvent to biomass mass ratio of 80 g of water per gram of acai residue was used. The process was carried out at 170 and 200 degrees C, during 20 min, using water flow of 20 mL min(-1) (15 Mpa system). Then, the residual biomass was submitted to the anaerobic digestion process using a reactor with pretreatment (integration) and a control reactor, both in semi-continuous regime and under mesophilic conditions (35 degrees C). The acai stone had a high carbohydrate concentration including 43.81% cellulose and 25.89% hemicellulose. For the evaluated conditions, subcritical water pretreatment at 200 degrees C gave the bestresultsforyield of reducing sugars, total reducing sugars and monosaccharide concentration. Anaerobic digestion experiments resulted in analkalinity between 150 and 1537 mgCaCO3.L-1 for the control reactor and between 249 and 491 mgCaCO3.L-1 for the reactor integration.Acetic acid was the main volatile fatty acid produced in both reactors, but butyric acid also had a very high concentration in the control reactor. The methane composition in the biogas for the integration reactor in the stabilization phase was between 60 and 80%, while for the control reactor it was in the range between 40 and 60%. The accumulated biogas yield was 7.79 and 791.81 L.KgTVS(-1) for the control and integration reactor, respectively. Anaerobic digestion using the acai hydrolysate obtained by subcritical water pretreatment showed a significant advantage over the control digestion, resulting in 30% more methane in the biogas and 100 times higheryield.

Mathematical models comparison of biogas production from anaerobic digestion of microwave pretreated mixed sludge,"Microwave (MW) sludge pretreatment enhances anaerobic digestion in terms of organics solubilization, sludge de-waterability and biogas production. The aim here is to optimize different biogas models under MW pretreatment conditions. Biogas generated from MW pretreatment of waste activated sludge under seven different MW intensities and temperatures is measured. Four biogas mathematical models, namely Modified-Gompertz (MG), Logistic-function, Reaction-Curve (RC) and exponential-rise (ER) are optimized under the seven different cases. The tunable model parameters are estimated using the gradient-based optimization technique. The performance measure of each model for the multiple experimental cases is consistent. Results reveal that the LF and MG are better fitted with experimental data than the RC and ER models. MG proves to be the best among the tested models based on percentage error (4.5%) while the RC results in the highest errors of 16.77%. However, the MG requires high computational efforts due to number of parameters. The ER, being simple and requires less computational time and at reasonable relatively errors of 10.5% is considered the best. These findings of optimal fitted model, model parameters, and its kinetics can set the stage for large scale predictive model development for biogas generation similar to those utilized for LandGEM-USEPA.

Enhancement of microalgae anaerobic digestion by thermo-alkaline pretreatment with lime (CaO),"The aim of this study was to evaluate for the first time the effect of a thermo-alkaline pretreatment with lime (CaO) on microalgae anaerobic digestion. The pretreatment was carried out by adding different CaO doses (4 and 10%) at different temperatures (room temperature (25 degrees C), 55 and 72 degrees C). The exposure time was 4 days for pretreatments at 25 degrees C, and 24 h for pretreatments at 55 and 72 degrees C. Following, a biochemicalmethane potential test was conducted with pretreated and untreated microalgae. According to the results, the pretreatment enhanced proteins solubilisation by 32.4% and carbohydrates solubilisation by 31.4% with the highest lime dose and temperature (10% CaO and 72 degrees C). Furthermore, anaerobic digestion kinetics were improved in all cases (from 0.08 to 0.14 day(-1) for untreated and pretreated microalgae, respectively). The maximum biochemical methane potential increase (25%) was achieved with 10% CaO at 72 degrees C, in accordance with the highest biomass solubilisation.

Effects of thermal pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of Nannochloropsis salina biomass,"The marine microalga Nannochloropsis sauna was investigated as feedstock for anaerobic digestion under batch and semi-continuous conditions for the first time. Biodegradability and methane yield were low under both digestion conditions. Thermal pretreatment prior to anaerobic digestion significantly increased the methane yield from 0.2 to 0.57 m(3) kg VS-1 under batch conditions and from 0.13 to 0.27 m(3) kg VS-1 in semi-continuous digestion. Still, the methane yield was limited with semi-continuous feeding due to volatile fatty acid (VFA) accumulation in the digester caused by high ammonium and salt concentrations in the feedstock. Despite VFA accumulation adaption of the microorganisms to the changing conditions and high buffer capacity resulted in steady methane production. A first energy balance considering the required heat for thermal pretreatment revealed significant benefit from the pretreatment. Conversely, the high energy demand for dewatering algal cultures is one major bottleneck for industrial-scale processing of microalgae. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Increasing the severity factor of hydrothermal pretreatment from 1.59 to 3.83 promoted the degradation of organic particulates in Sargassum, resulting in a maximum soluble chemical oxygen demand yield of 27,250 +/- 75 mg/L or 237% greater than the unpretreated biomass. However, no linear relationship exists between increased solubilisation and biogas productivity. Peak methane recovery of 116.72 +/- 2.14 mL/gVS was achieved at severity factor 2.65 with the decrease thereafter attributed to the formation of Maillard reaction products and inhibitory compounds during hydrothermal pretreatment. The hydrogen sulfide content in the biogas generated also diminished from 3% to 1%. Additionally, the digestate of biogas production is pathogen-free, nutrient-rich and exhibits biofertiliser potential.","Thompson, TM; Young, BR; Baroutian, S",Macroalgae; Sargassum; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Fertiliser,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2020.118527,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,algae,sargassum,,79,38,27.5,1.21,22,,,
"Enzymatic Pretreatment of Microalgae: Cell Wall Disruption, Biomass Solubilisation and Methane Yield Increase","Anaerobic digestion of microalgal biomass for biogas production may be limited due to the cell wall resulting in an inefficient bioconversion. Enzymatic pretreatments are applied for inducing cell damage/lysis and organic matter solubilisation and this way increasing biogas production. We evaluated enzymatic pretreatments in different conditions for comparing in relation to cell wall rupture, increase of soluble material and increase in biogas production through anaerobic digestion performance in BMP assay. Chlorella sorokiniana cultures were subjected to three different enzymatic pretreatments, each under four different conditions of enzyme/substrate ratio, pH and application time. The results showed increases over 21% in biogas productions for all enzymatic pretreatments. Enzymatic pretreatment was effective at damaging microalgae cell wall, releasing organic compounds and increasing the rate and final methane yield in BMP tests. We observed a synergistic activity between the mixtures enzymes, which would depend on operational conditions used for each pretreatment.","Cordova, O; Passos, F; Chamy, R",Microalgae; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Enzymes; Pretreatment; Synergistic activity,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-019-03044-8,Biological,enzyme,,micro-algae,chlorella,sorokiniana,,,,,,,,
Analysis of the extrusion as a pretreatment for the anaerobic digestion process,"In the last year anaerobic digestion have become widespread throughout Europe, since anaerobic digestion provides the possibility to recover energy from the produced biogas from different natural materials. Among the factor that are influencing on the mass transfer in each biological step of anaerobic digestion, both the composition and the quality of the substrate play a fundamental role. According to this, the schemes of substrate pretreatments can be used in order to optimize biological process yield. In this work the application of an extruder to increase the methane yield, and so the electric energy that can be produced, are examined. An extruder was tested on nine samples of maize silage and on one sample constituted by a mix of silage maize and manure. The biogas and methane yield after 1, 6, 16, 24 and 33 days of batch tests were measured. By analyzing the obtained values it can be observed an improvement, deriving from the extruder utilization, that can lead to values from 0 to 15% and so an improvement of the electric energy that can lead to values from 0 to 6.5% (the lower increase of electricity is due to the extruder self-consumption).

Acetogenesis and methanogenesis liquid digestates for pretreatment of rice straw: A holistic approach for efficient biomethane production and nutrient recycling,"The present work investigated the potential of acidogenesis digestate rich in volatile fatty acids (Bio-D-Acid) and methanogenesis digestate rich in ammonia (Bio-D-Meth) as a green method for the pretreatment of rice straw and biomethane production. After pretreatment with Bio-D-Meth for 48 h, a maximum hemicellulose reduction of 22.4% was recorded, while 48 h of Bio-D-Acid showed the lowest reduction of 15.7%. In addition, pretreatment for 48 h with Bio-D-Meth and Bio-D-Acid showed significant removal of lignin by 16.6 and 11.0%, respectively. SEM and FTIR confirmed major increase in straw porosity and degradation after all applied pretreatments. The highest significant biomethane content of 71.2% was recorded in 24 h Bio-D-Acid-pretreated straw. However, the highest significant yield of 249.1 L kg(-1) VS was recorded from the 48 h Bio-D-Meth-pretreated straw, which was 9.8, 19.6, and 27.0% higher than 24 h Bio-D-Meth-, 24 h Bio-D-Acid and 48 h Bio-D-Meth-treated straw, respectively. Importantly, pretreatment with Bio-D-Meth for 24 h showed the highest estimated net bioenergy output of 7.37 GJ ton(-1) dry straw, which represented 28.6 and 0.13% increase over that of the control and 48 h Bio-D-Meth-pretreated straw, respectively.

Benefit of sodium hydroxide pretreatment of ensiled sorghum forage on the anaerobic reactor stability and methane production,"The assessment of the pretreatment effect on the anaerobic digestion process is generally based on the results of batch tests, which may fail in truly predicting full-scale anaerobic reactors performance. Therefore, in this study, the effect of alkaline pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion of ensiled sorghum forage was evaluated by comparing the results of two semi-continuous CSTR (Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor) anaerobic reactors. Results showed that an alkaline pretreatment step, prior to the anaerobic digestion of ensiled sorghum forage, can have a beneficial effect both in enhancing methane production (an increase of 25% on methane production was observed, if compared to that of untreated sorghum) and in giving more stability to the anaerobic digestion process.

Integration of Shiitake cultivation and solid-state anaerobic digestion for utilization of woody biomass,"Pretreatment technologies that can not only reduce the recalcitrance of woody biomass but also achieve a high benefit-cost ratio are desirable for bioenergy production from woody biomass. In this study, an integrated process was proposed and conducted by pretreating woodchips via Shiitake cultivation for improved methane yield during solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD), and simultaneously producing mushrooms as a high-value co-product. Shiitake cultivation using woodchips as the main substrate ingredient obtained mushroom yields comparable to those using a commercial substrate. Enzymatic digestibility and cumulative methane yields (133-160 L kg(-1) VS during 62 days of SS-AD) of pretreated substrates (spent mushroom substrate) were at least 1.5 times as high as those of untreated woodchips. Compared to a sole SS-AD process, the integrated Shiitake cultivation/SS-AD process increased methane production and solid waste reduction per kilogram of woodchips by about 1.5 and 8 times, respectively.

Enhancing the solid-state anaerobic digestion of fallen leaves through simultaneous alkaline treatment,"Previous studies have shown that alkali pretreatment prior to anaerobic digestion (AD) can increase the digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass and methane yield. In order to simplify the process and reduce the capital cost, simultaneous alkali treatment and anaerobic digestion was evaluated for methane production from fallen leaves. The highest methane yield of 82 L/kg volatile solids (VS) was obtained at NaOH loading of 3.5% and substrate-to-inoculum (S/I) ratio of 4.1. The greatest enhancement in methane yield was achieved at S/I ratio of 6.2 with NaOH loading of 3.5% which was 24-fold higher than that of the control (without NaOH addition). Reactors at S/I ratio of 8.2 resulted in failure of the AD process. In addition, increasing the total solid (TS) content from 20% to 26% reduced biogas yield by 35% at S/I ratio of 6.2 and NaOH loading of 3.5%. Cellulose and hemicellulose degradation and methane yields are highly related. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Enhancement of methane production from various microalgae cultures via novel ozonation pretreatment,"In this work, the application of ozone, an unexplored pretreatment to improve methane production from three mixed microalgae sources was investigated. Ozonation at various, culture-dependent dosages was employed and its impact on the efficiency of subsequent anaerobic digestion was examined in comparison with untreated biomass. Regardless of the O-3 pretreatment conditions, the methane yield in all cases could be increased by various extents (6-66%).

Enhancing the Anaerobic Digestion of Corn Stalks Using Composite Microbial Pretreatment,"A composite microbial system (XDC-2) was used to pretreat and hydrolyze corn stalk to enhance anaerobic digestion. The results of pretreatment indicated that sCOD concentrations of hydrolysate were highest (8,233 mg/l) at the fifth day. XDC-2 efficiently degraded the corn stalk by nearly 45%, decreasing the cellulose content by 22.7% and the hemicellulose content by 74.1%. Total levels of volatile products peaked on the fifth day. The six major compounds present were ethanol (0.29 g/l), acetic acid (0.55 g/l), 1,2-ethanediol (0.49 g/l), propionic acid (0.15 g/l), butyric acid (0.22 g/l), and glycerine (2.48 g/l). The results of anaerobic digestion showed that corn stalks treated by XDC-2 produced 68.3% more total biogas and 87.9% more total methane than untreated controls. The technical digestion time for the treated corn stalks was 35.7% shorter than without treatment. The composite microbial system pretreatment could be a cost-effective and environmentally friendly microbial method for efficient biological conversion of corn stalk into bioenergy.","Yuan, XF; Li, PP; Wang, H; Wang, XF; Cheng, X; Cui, ZJ",Composite microbial system; biogas; pretreatment; hydrolysate; anaerobic digestion,2011,http://dx.doi.org/10.4014/jmb.1011.11026,Biological,microbial consortium,xdc-2,lignocellulose,corn,stalk,95,90.25,41,1.1,,,,

The pretreatments were done at 30 degrees C for 72 h, and anaerobic digestion for 5 weeks. The results showed that the cumulative biogas yield from pretreatment co-digestion group RSS (214.1 NmL/g TSsubstrate) was 318% higher than the untreated group CG RSS (51.2 NmL/g TSsubstrate). The cumulative methane yield from RSS was 94.3 NmL CH4/g TSsubstrate, which was 807% higher than that of untreated group (CG RSS 10.4 NmL CH4/g TSsubstrate), and 90% of potential biogas generation was reached in 17 days, which was 39% shorter than that of pretreatment mono-digestion groups (28 days). These results suggested that rice and soybean straw co-digestion exhibits a positive synergistic effect and Trichoderma reesei RUT C30 provides an effective method for improving biogas production.

Mechanical pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass to improve biogas production: Comparison of results for giant reed and wheat straw,"The effects of a mechanical pretreatment were determined on the methane yield of giant reed stems (Arundo Donax) and wheat straw. The feedstocks were pretreated using a two stages dry milling device, whose working capacity - up to 1,2 t h(-1) - can meet the requirements of medium and large-scale biogas plants. Untreated and pretreated materials were anaerobically digested in batch reactors under mesophilic conditions for 28 days. The cumulative biogas production from the pretreated giant reed stems exceeded 212 Nm(3) t(-1) of volatile solids, showing a 137% gain as compared to the raw material; furthermore, a significant decrease in the acid detergent fiber content was observed in the processed material. Pretreated straw reached a cumulative methane yield of 250.3 Nm(3) t(-1) of volatile solids, gaining a 49.1% as compared to the feedstock; no statistically significant differences were observed in physicochemical composition following pretreatment. The aforementioned gains resulted far above the known range for mechanical pretreatments. The specific electric energy requirement for pretreatment decreased from 76.5 kWh t(-1) of processed giant reed stems to 66.0 kWh t(-1) for straw. With reference to the use of biogas in CHP plants, the net electric energy output from pretreated materials was enhanced by about 111.7% and 38.3% as compared to the feedstocks for reed and straw, respectively. The cost for the extra electric energy produced by pretreatment was estimated at 0.034 and 0.048 V kWh(-1) for giant reed and straw, respectively, resulting fully compatible with the selling price for the electric energy produced from biogas in force in Italy.

Evaluation of single vs. staged mesophilic anaerobic digestion of kitchen waste with and without microwave pretreatment,"Effects of single and dual stage (acidogenic methanogenic) mesophilic anaerobic digestion (AD) of kitchen waste (KW) was evaluated at hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 20, 15, 12 and 9 d with and without thermal microwave (MW) pretreatment (145 degrees C). Anaerobic acidification in terms of acid accumulation was superior compared to microaerophilic acidification. Maximum anaerobic acidification of KW was determined to occur with an HRT of 2 d which was then selected for the acidification stage. The dual stage AD system fed with untreated MW produced the maximum biogas and volatile solids (VS) stabilization efficiencies at the shortest HRT of 9 d. Conversely, for free liquid resulting from MW pretreatment of KW the two stage reactor at 20 d HRT produced three fold more methane compared with the untreated free liquid control. However, MW pretreatment and AD of the free liquid fraction only, was not a sustainable treatment option. For KW, staging of the AD process had a greater positive impact on waste stabilization and methane yield compared to single stage reactors or MW pretreatment.

Effect of Thermal Pretreatment of Pineapple Peel Waste in Biogas Production using Response Surface Methodology,"This study aims to determine the effect of thermal pretreatment from pineapple peel waste on biogas production using a batch anaerobic digestion process. The experimental process was carried out on various variables, including observation time (30 days), operating temperature (25 - 35 degrees C), the ratio of starter and sample (1:1), also applied by two treatments, namely the anaerobic digester process without pretreatment and pretreatment using a hot water bath with a temperature of 60 degrees C, 80 degrees C, and 100 degrees C, with a time duration of 25, 45, and 65 minutes. The results showed that the thermal pretreatment given to pineapple peel waste accelerated the biogas production process and reduced the lag phase in the anaerobic digestion process. The highest biogas production volume was obtained from pineapple peel waste, which was 616.33 mL (357.190 mL/g volatile solids), pretreated for 25 minutes at 60 degrees C (variable B3). The lowest biogas production was obtained from pineapple peel waste without pretreatment (variable A), which was 384.33 mL or 219.619 mL/g of volatile solids. The optimum % yield value of CH4 gas content reached 67.27%, which was achieved in the pineapple peel hot water bath pretreatment at a temperature of 100 degrees C with a water bath time of 25 minutes. Meanwhile, pineapple peel waste without a pretreatment hot water bath obtained a % CH4 yield of 60.19%. The lignocellulose analysis results with the highest hemicellulose and cellulose content were found in pineapple peel waste, pretreated for 45 minutes at a temperature of 80 degrees C (B9 & B10), with 22.1% and 55.2%, respectively. The B9 and B10 samples obtained the lowest lignin content of 0.41% for both samples.","Arifan, F; Broto, RTDW; Sumardiono, S; Sutaryo; Dewi, AL; Yudanto, YA; Sapatra, EF",Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Pineapple peel waste; Thermal pretreatment,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.14716/ijtech.v13i3.4747,Physical,thermal,,lignocellulose,Ananas comosus,peel,,,,,,,,
Mesophilic aerobic digestion: An efficient and inexpensive biological pretreatment to improve biogas production from highly-recalcitrant pinewood,"Biological pretreatments and their combination with chemical and physical pretreatments are among the inexpensive methods for the improvement of biogas production from lignocellulosic biomass. In this study, mesophilic aerobic digestion was studied as a biological pretreatment to improve biogas production from pinewood. Its effects in combination with other pretreatments, i.e., liquid hot water (LHW), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and ultrasonic pretreatments, were also investigated. LHW and Alkali (using 8% w/w NaOH) pretreatments were performed at less severe conditions (100 degrees C for 10 min) to evaluate the synergistic effect of these thermochemical pretreatments on biogas production. The ultrasonic pretreatment was performed at 40 KHz for 30 min at 40 degrees C. Biological pretreatment was carried out using aerobic sludge at 37 degrees C for 10 days. The aerobic digestion was the only pretreatment that could individually improve the methane yield from pinewood by 7.3 folds. However, the highest methane yield (57.7 mL/g VS of pretreated pinewood) was obtained by the combination of NaOH, biological, and ultrasonic pretreatments, which was 11.2 folds higher than that of the untreated substrate. It was concluded that the pretreatment with aerobic digestion could significantly improve the biogas production yield, especially in combination with mild thermo-chemical pretreatments.

Thermochemical pretreatment of lignocellulose residues: assessment of the effect on operational conditions and their interactions on the characteristics of leachable fraction,"Annually, large amounts of agricultural residues are produced in Chile, which can be turned into a good opportunity to diversify the energy matrix. These residues have a slow hydrolysis stage during anaerobic digestion; therefore, the application of a pretreatment seems to be an alternative to improve the process. This work focused on applying a thermochemical pretreatment with NaOH on two lignocellulosic residues. The experiments were performed according to a 24 factorial design. The factors studied in a 24 factorial design were: temperature (60 and 120 degrees C), pretreatment time (10 and 30 minutes), NaOH dose (2 and 4%), and residue size (< 1 and 1-3 mm for wheat straw; 1-5 and 5-10 mm for corn stover). The analyzed response variables were the solubilization of organic matter, and the biodegradability of the lignocellulose hydrolysate. The statistical analysis of the data allowed the identification of the experimental conditions that maximized solubilization of organic matter and biodegradability. The main results showed that more aggressive experimental conditions could increase the breaking down of the structure; in addition, the time of pretreatment was not significant. Conversely, the less aggressive experimental conditions, regarding regent dosage and downsizing, favored the release of biodegradable organic matter. The main conclusion of this study was the identification of the operational conditions of the thermochemical pretreatment that promote maximum biogas production, which was caused due to the solubilization of a large amount of organic matter, but not because of the increase in biodegradability of the released organic matter.","Vasquez, D; Contreras, E; Palma, C; Carvajal, A",anaerobic digestion; biogas; corn stover; pretreatment; wheat straw,2015,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2015.398,Physical,thermal,,lignocellulose,corn,stover,,,,,,,,

Wheat Straw Optimization via its Efficient Pretreatment for Improved Biogas Production,"The complex indigenous configuration of non-bio-labile wheat straw necessitates its pretreatment to optimize the breakdown of its structural components for its ultimate conversion into biogas by means of anaerobic digestion. In this research work, wheat straw was pretreated with potassium hydroxide (KOH) to facilitate its improved biodegradability. The pretreatment of wheat straw was also obvious in terms of its crystallinity resulting in the improved amorphous regions compared to the control wheat straw. The results showed that pretreated wheat straw digestion transpired into comparatively higher removal of TS (86%), VS (89%) and total lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose (22%) than that obtained with control wheat straw. Maximum biogas production accrued was 1550 mLN per day with optimized dosing of KOH compared to 967 mLN per day obtained with control wheat straw, implying that the cumulative biogas production was improved by 45% using pretreated wheat straw than that using control wheat straw. These results suggested that pretreated wheat straw digestion led to a significant improvement in the biogas yield.","Memon, MJ; Memon, AR",Wheat Straw; Pretreatment; Hydrolysis; Lignocellulose; Anaerobic Digestion; Biogas,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.28991/cej-2020-03091528,Chemical,alkaline,koh,lignocellulose,wheat,straw,,,,,,,,
Evaluation and modelling of methane production from corn stover pretreated with various physicochemical techniques,"Lignocellulosic by-products from agricultural crops represent an important raw material for anaerobic digestion and clean renewable, which is a key component of the circular economy. Lignocellulose is recalcitrant to biodegradation and pretreatments are required to increase methane yield during anaerobic digestion. In this work, the efficacy of different physicochemical pretreatments was compared using corn stover biomass as substrate. Anaerobic digestion of untreated and pretreated corn stover was performed in batch mode at mesophilic temperature (38 degrees C) and organic matter solubilization of pretreated substrates was also investigated. The highest organic matter solubilization occurred in autoclave pretreatment (soluble chemical oxygen demand = 5630 +/- 42 mg O-2 L-1). However, the highest methane yield was obtained using alkaline pretreatment (367 +/- 35 mL CH4 g(-1) VSadded). Alkaline pretreatment increased methane yield by 43.3% compared to untreated control (256 +/- 15 mL CH4 g(-1) VSadded). Two mathematical models (i.e. first-order kinetics and transfer function) were utilized to fit the experimental data with the aim of assessing anaerobic biodegradation and to obtain the kinetic constants in all cases studied. Both models adequately fit the experimental results. The kinetic constant, k, of the first-order model increased by 92.8% when stover was pretreated with sulphuric acid compared with control.

Biochar as an Additive in Anaerobic Digestion of Municipal Sludge: Biochar Properties and Their Effects on the Digestion Performance,"Fast pyrolysis of biomass pretreated with mineral acid produces high quality bio-oil, however, biochar produced from this process has not been characterized and its performance as an additive to anaerobic digestion (AD) is unknown. This study reports the effects of physicochemical properties of two distinct biochars on AD of municipal sludge: one was produced from pyrolysis of raw corn stover (BC-1); the other was produced from sulfuric acid pretreatment of the same corn stover (BC-2). BC-1 had higher carbon content, alkalinity, and specific surface area but lower ash and sulfur than BC-2. Both biochars contained volatile fatty acids and residual sugars serving as substrates for anaerobic bacteria to enhance biogas/methane production. When the biochars were added to the AD, their effects on biogas production showed contrary trends. Addition of BC-1 resulted in higher methane yield and content, while BC-2 reduced methane yield and content. The strong buffering capacity of BC-1 was a major factor for its beneficial effect, while the high sulfur content of BC-2 was inhibitory to anaerobic bacteria. Collectively, the results indicated that the effects of biochar on AD depends on biochar properties, and selection of appropriate biochar was important in facilitating higher biogas production and maintaining a stable process.","Zhou, HQ; Brown, RC; Wen, ZY",Anaerobic digestion; Biochar; Acid pretreatment; Biogas; Buffering capacity,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c00571,Chemical,acidic,,activated sludge,municipal sludge,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, fast-growing, high-yielding and organic matter-enriched of Napier grass was promising energy crop for biogas production.","Dussadee, N; Ramaraj, R; Cheunbarn, T",Biogas; Dry anaerobic digestion; LBR; Napier grass; Pretreatment,2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-017-0646-4,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,lignocellulose,Pennisetum purpureum,grass,22,,44,2,,,,
Accelerated high-solids anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge using low-temperature thermal pretreatment,"High-solids anaerobic digestion (HSAD) of sewage sludge is a promising alternative to conventional anaerobic digestion due to its use of smaller digesters and its reduced energy requirement; however, long digestion time is a key shortcoming. This study investigated whether low-temperature thermal pretreatment of sludge could accelerate high-solids digestion. The results showed that after 30 min treatment at 60, 70 and 80 degrees C, 9.1, 13.0 and 16.6% of sludge solids, respectively, were disintegrated and sludge flow indices increased from 0 to 0.098, 0.195 and 0.249, respectively. As a consequence, thermal pretreatment at 60, 70 and 80 degrees C increased the quantity of accessible substrates and decreased sludge viscosity such that, compared to the control, biogas production in the batch anaerobic digestion experiments increased by 7.3, 15.6 and 24.4%, respectively, and the apparent kinetic constants increased from 0.19 d(-1) to 0.29, 0.39 and 0.39 d(-1), respectively. A high concentration of volatile fatty acids and a low pH resulted from thermal pretreatment, but neither of these exerted a significant negative effect on the subsequent HSAD. The optimal pretreatment condition was a temperature of 70 degrees C for 30 min. In the semi-continuous pilot scale HSAD experiment with optimal pretreatment, biogas yield increased by 11% compared to that with no pretreatment, and the digestion time decreased from 22 to 15 days. The improved digestion following low-temperature thermal pretreatment confirmed the efficacy of this technique to accelerate high-solids anaerobic digestion, as well as increase biogas yield.

Pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse with dilute citric acid and enzymatic hydrolysis: Use of black liquor and solid fraction for biogas production,"This study evaluated the pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse (SCB) with dilute citric acid solution for biogas production. The black liquor (BL) from pretreatment and residual solid fraction (RSF) obtained after enzymatic hydrolysis were used as substrates for the biogas production. After saccharifications of the pretreated solid fractions performed with Cellic (R) CTec 3 cocktail, the highest concentration of total reducing sugars (TRS) was in the range of 10.7-184.8 g L-1 and the sugar yields were in the range of 3.5-88.8%. For BL, the contents of glucose, xylose, and arabinose were in the range of 1.9-8.9 g L-1, 4.0-24.7 g L-1, and 0.2-5.4 g L-1, respectively. Biogas production from BL and RSF resulted, respectively, in maximum values of 563.6 and 57.8 NmL g(COD)(-1), indicating the feasibility of using dilute citric acid pretreatment coupled to biogas production in biorefineries. Brief energy and economic assessment were carried out considering the energy balance (thermal energy generated by burning biogas - thermal energy spent in the pretreatment), as well as revenue from a possible sale of electricity generated in a combined heat and power system.

In-situ microaeration of anaerobic digester treating buffalo manure for enhanced biogas yield,"Microaeration pretreatment can enhance lignin degradation of lignocellulosic biomass and subsequent biogas production during anaerobic digestion (AD). However, the reported values of effective aeration dose, aeration contact time, and aeration frequency differ with substrates riddling the selection of a suitable combination. A serial approach was adopted to identify the suitable combination for the degradation of lignin in the buffalo manure and improvement of the biogas production. Single and Multiple injections of three aeration doses of 5.3, 7.3, and 9.3 mL O-2/g VS were tested at 5 different contact times- 6, 12, 24, 36, and 47 h. Results for acid-soluble lignin (% ASL) indicated the suitability of 12 h contact time with a single injection of 7.3 mL O-2/g VS for lignin degradation and biogas enhancement for AD of buffalo manure. This combination achieved 78% higher ASL content and a 32% increase in average daily biogas yield than the control. Finally, the kinetic parameters obtained through the modified Gompertz model accurately predicted the biogas potential of the process (R-2 > 0.93). The results of this study can be referenced for improving the yield of similar biomass to bioenergy initiatives by employing a low-cost pretreatment strategy of in-situ microaeration.

Alkaline Pretreatment of Banana Stems for Methane Generation: Effects of Temperature and Physicochemical Changes,"The effects of NaOH pretreatment temperature on the physicochemical characteristics and methane production of anaerobically digested banana stems were investigated in this paper. With the increase of pretreatment temperature from 0 degrees C to 100 degrees C, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the soak liquid in the treated biomass approximately linearly increased from 5.9 g/L for the untreated stems to 34.0 g/L. A weight loss of 5.1% was observed for the untreated material, while it was up to 31.2% for the sample treated at 100 degrees C. The removal of lignin and hemicellulose accounted for the majority of the weight loss. The removal rates of lignin and hemicellulose increased from 15.0% to 41.6% and 1.9% to 23.6% when the treatment temperature increased from 0 degrees C to 100 degrees C, respectively. Moreover, the crystalline index (CI) of the banana stems also increased with rising temperature, resulting from the dissolution of amorphous cellulose with increasingly harsher alkaline environments. The optimal pretreatment temperature for banana stems was confirmed at 50 degrees C. In these conditions, methane was produced via anaerobic digestion with 239.9 mL/g total solid (TS) yield, which represented an increase of 66.7% over untreated banana stems.","Chen, XL; Han, YX; Zhang, CM; Feng, GQ; Zhao, MX; Yue, RX; Li, YF; Jiang, L; Zhang, L; Li, JH; Li, SZ",Alkaline pretreatment; Temperature; Anaerobic digestion; Banana stems; Biogas,2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.15376/biores.12.3.5601-5616,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,lignocellulose,stems,banana,96,89,44,,,,,

Effect of thermochemical pretreatment on the solubilization and anaerobic biodegradability of the red macroalga Palmaria palmata,"The rapid development of anaerobic digestion brought with it the problem of biomass resources and supply. Marine biomass is emerging as an advantageous substrate. Such macroalgae as Palmaria palmata are promising substrates for anaerobic digestion as they possess a high methane potential (308 +/- 9 mL gvs(-1)). The aim of this paper was to study the efficiency of the anaerobic digestion of P. palmata after a range of thermal and chemical pretreatment. The anaerobic digestion of raw and pretreated macroalgae was carried out in batch mesophilic biomethane potential tests (BMP). Thermal (between 20 and 200 degrees C) and thermo-chemical (addition of NaOH and HCl) pretreatment were performed on P. palmata. Thermal pretreatments at 20, 70, 85 and 120 degrees C and acid or soda pretreatments at 160 degrees C had no significant effect on P. palmata's methane potential. After high temperature pretreatment (180-200 degrees C), the BMP decreased with the temperature which can be explained by the formation of refractory compounds in the liquid fraction. In contrast, the addition of 0.04 gNaOH gTS(-1) at 20 degrees C led to a release of proteins and induced an increase in the BMP from 308 +/- 9 mL gvs(-1) (untreated) to 365 +/- 9 mL gvs(-1).

Sludge disintegration and anaerobic digestion enhancement by alkaline-thermal pretreatment: Economic evaluation and microbial population analysis,"Alkaline-thermal pretreatment was examined for waste activated sludge (WAS) disintegration and subsequent anaerobic digestion (AD). Pretreatment at 60 degrees C was estimated to provide better economic benefits than higher temperature conditions. The maximum methane yield of 215.6 mL/g COD was achieved when WAS was pretreated at 60 degrees C and pH 10 for 24 h, which was 46.6% higher than untreated WAS. The pretreatment condition also provided the maximum net savings. The degree of sludge disintegration, considering both loosely bound-extracellular polymeric substance and soluble COD, would be a better indicator to predict anaerobic digestibility than the solubilization rate that considers soluble COD alone. Microbial analysis implied that pretreatment facilitated the growth of hydrolytic bacteria, phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. In addition, sludge pretreatment enhanced the growth of both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens, genera Meth-anosaeta and Methanobacterium.

Anaerobic mono-digestion of Tithonia diversifolia (Wild Mexican sunflower),"Anaerobic digestion was carried out in this study using the shoot of Tithonia diversifolia using a consortium of microorganisms. Combinations of mechanical and thermo-alkaline (Sodium hydroxide and Potassium hydroxide) pretreatments were applied to two samples (X and Y) of the mixture while the third sample (Z) had no thermo-alkaline treatment. Prior to pretreatment, the Central Composite Design was used for optimizing the pretreatment temperature and time. The physicochemical characteristics of T. diversifolia shoot were carried out using standard methods. Modeling of the generated biogas data was done using the Response Surface Methodology. The optimal conditions for this process were statistically predicted as Temperature (S-1) of 30.00 degrees C, pH (S-2) of 7.5, Retention time (S-3) of 30 day, Total solids (S-4) of 12.00 g/kg and Volatile solids (S-5) of 4.00 g/kg.

Analyses revealed the average gas composition to be within the range of 65 +/- 1% methane and 26 +/- 2% carbon dioxide for digestion 'X'; 59 +/- 1.5% Methane and 22.5 +/- 2%% Carbon dioxide for digestion 'Y' while it was 53 +/- 2% Methane and 20.5 +/- 2% Carbon dioxide for digestions 'Z'. The roots mean squared error, coefficient of determination, and the predicted value were used to determine the fitness of the model. All the obtained values show that the model had a high predictive ability for the study. The energy assessment showed positive energy balances from the thermoalkaline pretreated experiment and this can be increased via the use of higher substrate loading in order to increase the economic feasibility of the applied pretreatment.

Enzymatic pretreatment was conducted using lignase enzyme. Carbon to Nitrogen ratio (C/N ratio) was varied from 35, 40, 45, and 50. The variation of C/N ratio is made by adding some amount of technical urea to the substrate. Biogas formed was measured by using water displacement method every two days to know biogas production daily. The result showed that enzymatic pretreatment could increase biogas production varied from 30 to 55%. The highest biogas production was obtained at C/N ratio 35.

In-situ injection of potassium hydroxide into briquetted wheat straw and meadow grass - Effect on biomethane production,"Alkaline pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass has been intensively investigated but heavy water usage and environmental pollution from wastewater limits its industrial application. This study presents a pretreatment technique by in-situ injection of potassium hydroxide concentrations ranging from 0.8% to 10% (w/w) into the briquetting process of wheat straw and meadow grass. Results show that the biomethane yield and hydrolysis rate was improved significantly with a higher impact on wheat straw compared to meadow grass. The highest biomethane yield from wheat straw briquettes of 353 mL. g (1) VS was obtained with 6.27% (w/w) potassium hydroxide injection, which was 14% higher than from untreated wheat straw. The hydrolysis rates of wheat straw and meadow grass increased from 4.27 x 10 (2) to 5.32 x 10 (2) d (1) and 4.19 x 10 (2) to 6.00 x 10 (2) d (1), respectively. The low water usage and no wastewater production make this a promising technology. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Potential of high-frequency ultrasounds to improve sludge anaerobic conversion and surfactants removal at different food/inoculum ratio,"High-frequency ultrasounds have recently gained interest as oxidative technique for sonochemical degradation of organic contaminants in water. In this study an innovative approach applying 200 kHz ultrasounds to improve both sludge anaerobic biodegradability and decontamination is proposed. Digestion tests were performed on batch reactors fed either with untreated or sonicated sludge, at different food/inoculum (F/I) ratio, in the range 0.3-0.9. First order kinetic highlighted a decreasing trend of the hydrolysis rate by increasing F/I, both for untreated and sonicated sludge. Positive effect of ultrasounds on specific biogas production was evident, but the conversion rate for pretreated sludge was strongly affected by F/I, and decreased by increasing F/I. Anionic surfactants anaerobic removal occurred in all tests, but the effect of ultrasounds was significant only at F/I = 0.3. By pretreating sludge with high frequency ultrasounds, low F/I was the ideal ratio improving both sludge anaerobic digestion and decontamination. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Improvement of methane production from P. canaliculata through mechanical pretreatment,"In order to increase the methane yield from biomass, this paper investigates the mechanical pretreatment effect of a Hollander beater on the anaerobic digestion process of Pelvetia canaliculata macroalgae using a response surface methodology (RSM). Higher values on methane yield were obtained at lower F/I ratios, with an increase up to 2.5-fold at an F/I value of 0.3. A multi-objective optimization study was carried out with the aim of maximizing the methane yield while minimizing the pretreatment time. An optimum methane yield of 283 ml/gVS was obtained for 50 min pretreatment time and a ratio F/I of 0.3, which represents an increase of 45% compared to non-pretreated algae. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Improving biodegradability and biogas production of miscanthus using a combination of hydrothermal and alkaline pretreatment,"To alleviate the energy shortage and greenhouse effect, lignocellulosic biomass has received great attention for its sufficient produced in China rural areas. Miscanthus is a kind of effective energy crop for methane production due to its high organic content and biomass yield. While pretreatment is necessary before anaerobic digestion to improve the biodegradability of feedstock. A combination of hydrothermal and alkaline pretreatments was applied to reduce the recalcitrance of Miscanthus in this paper, and the results showed that the digestion performance was much better than single hydrothermally pretreated material. An 8% NaOH dosage at 175 degrees C was the best pretreatment condition and resulted in a 56.92% increase in biogas yield and a 45.4% reduction in digestion time compared to the control. Lignin was dissolved during hydrothermal alkaline pretreatment in a short retention time, causing destroyed structure of lignocellulose and high content of cellulose and hemicellulose maintaining.

Enhanced biomethanization of waste polylactic acid plastic by mild hydrothermal pretreatment: Taguchi orthogonal optimization and kinetics modeling,"Polylactic acid (PLA) plastic is becoming a popular alternative to traditional petroleum-based plastics, but the biodegradability in engineered biological system is still a matter of concern. In this study, the biodegradability of PLA plastic at mesophilic and thermophilic AD were investigated, and a hydrothermal pretreatment was proposed to enhance the hydrolysis of PLA plastic and subsequent biomethanization. For raw PLA plastic, the biodegradation results indicated that PLA was hardly biodegraded at mesophilic conditions (only 50.5 +/- 0.5 mL/g VS after 146 days). Although it was converted into biogas at thermophilic conditions after long incubation period (442.6 +/- 1.1 mL/g VS), the long digestion time (T-90 95.8 days) was destined to be infeasible for practical application. In contrast, hydrothermal pretreatment significantly enhanced the hydrolysis rates of PLA plastic in AD process from 0.001 day-1 for raw PLA plastic to 0.004-0.111 day (1). By balancing biogas production efficiency, energy and reagent cost, the conditions of 200 degrees C, 10 min and no alkali addition were recommended for hydrothermal pretreatment of waste PLA plastic in practice. At the optimized hydrothermal pretreatment conditions, 460.1 +/- 25.0 mL/g VS was achieved in less than 30 days, which was comparable for AD of food waste (FW). Furthermore, LCQEMS analysis proved that cleavages of ester bonds in PLA and its reaction with water molecule was the mechanism of triggering the hydrothermally decomposition of PLA. These results suggested the PLA-plastic waste co-mingled with OFMSW could be efficiently biomethanized into biogas by involving a mild hydrothermal pretreatment in practical application.

Enhancing the Performance on Anaerobic Digestion of Vinegar Residue by Sodium Hydroxide Pretreatment,"Vinegar residue (VR) is a by-product which produced by the process of vinegar production. To enhance the performance on methane production of VR and facilitate its resource utilization, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pretreatment was carried out. Results showed that with the concentration of NaOH increased, the cumulative methane yield ascended first and then declined. At NaOH concentration of 3.0 %, the cumulative methane yield was 205.86 mL g (VS) (-1) and improved 53.99 % comparing with the untreated VR. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and component analysis demonstrated the structural and compositional changes in VR after NaOH pretreatment. The results obtained in this study proved that NaOH pretreatment was really efficient for enhancing the capability of anaerobic digestion (AD) and increasing methane production. Through this technology, it not only provides a method to reduce the pollution to environment but also contributes to clean energy production. Meanwhile, the results of this research may serve as a promising and potential way for AD of VR in the future industrial applications.","Shen, J; Zhao, C; Liu, GQ; Chen, C",Anaerobic digestion; Vinegar residue; NaOH pretreatment; Biogas production; Enhancement,2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-016-9666-2,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,lignocellulose,vinegar residue,processing waste,,,,,,,,
Enhancement of biogas production from organic fraction of municipal solid waste using alkali pretreatment,"Anaerobic digestion is one of the most prospective and economical techniques to recover energy and simultaneously treat organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). However, more often than not, the complex polymeric structure of lignocellulosic fraction and high lipid content of Indian OFMSW prove to be hindrances in realizing the full potential of energy recovery through anaerobic digestion. Pretreatment of OFMSW is an effective method to enhance the efficiency of anaerobic digestion. This paper explores the effect of alkali pretreatment on change in characteristics of OFMSW in India and its subsequent impact on biogas generation. Pretreatment was carried out using 5 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution and varying the initial pH of OFMSW in the range of 8-13 for 24 h. Thereafter, batch anaerobic digestion assays of untreated and pretreated OFMSW were carried out using cow excrement as inoculum. Results indicate that NaOH pretreatment was advantageous in solubilizing the organic matter of OFMSW, thus increasing biogas yield and reduced digestion time. The cumulative biogas generation increased by 19.6-34.8% post-NaOH pretreatment. OFMSW pretreated with NaOH at pH 10 had maximum biogas yield of 407.1 mL/gVS with 68.9% methane content, as compared to 301.9 mL/gVS and 50.3% of untreated OFMSW. A preliminary cost assessment indicated a positive net profit for pretreatment of OFMSW with NaOH at pH ranges of 8-10.","Dasgupta, A; Chandel, MK",Alkali pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Municipal solid waste; India,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10163-020-00970-2,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,ofmsw,municipal solid waste,,,,,,,,,
Effective bio-pretreatment of sawdust waste with a novel microbial consortium for enhanced biomethanation,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) is considered an efficient cost-effective technology for sustainable biogas production from lignocellulosic wastes. A novel lignocellulosic degradation microbial consortium (LCDC) was isolated from rotten sawdust, and further used for sawdust pretreatment prior to AD. Results showed that pretreatment of sawdust for 10 days led to significant reduction in cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin contents by 37.5%, 39.6%, and 56.7%, respectively, with respect to the control. In addition, the pretreatment enhanced cumulative biogas yield, which reached its maximum value of 312.0 L kg (1) VS after 28 days of AD (25.6% higher than the corresponding control). Moreover, the maximum significant cumulative methane yield was recorded after 28 days of AD of the pretreated sawdust (155.2 L kg (1) VS), which represented 72.6% higher than the corresponding control. Significantly higher biomethane yield from sawdust pretreated with LCDC confirms that this process is more economical than the previous reports.

Live Steam-Pretreatment and Anaerobic Digestion of Waste Activated Sludge,"Steam pretreatments mixing waste activated sludge (WAS) with live steam were applied to decompose WAS, and to enhance its anaerobic digestion performance. Results showed that the optimum pretreatment condition was 120 degrees C for 10 min. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the pretreated group was improved to 14,000 mg/L, 18 times higher compared with the control group. The concentration of extracellular polymeric substances and soluble protein increased to 1866 mg/L and 1495 mg/L, respectively. Soluble COD increased exponentially with increasing specific energy; only a specific energy input of 271 kJ/kgTS was required. Analysis indicated that the particle size of sludge was reduced and the distribution was more uniform after the pretreatment. Results from the subsequent batch anaerobic digestion indicated that higher stability of the system and biogas production were obtained in the pretreated group. Compared with raw sludge, biogas production of pretreated sludge was improved by 122%, corresponding to 600 mL/g of volatile solids. The present study mostly assesses the live steam pretreatment of WAS and compares obtained results with previously examined thermal, chemical, or ultrasound pretreatments. Results demonstrate that live steam pretreatment significantly enhances the biogas production while requiring limited energy input only.","Gao, ZD; Zhang, CS; Su, HJ; Tan, TW",anaerobic digestion; biogas; live steam pretreatment; waste activated sludge,2013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ees.2012.0480,Physical,thermal,steam,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Saponification of fatty slaughterhouse wastes for enhancing anaerobic biodegradability,"The thermochemical pretreatment by saponification of two kinds of fatty slaughterhouse waste - aeroflotation fats and flesh fats from animal carcasses - was studied in order to improve the waste's anaerobic degradation. The effect of an easily biodegradable compound, ethanol, on raw waste biodegradation was also examined. The aims of the study were to enhance the methanisation of fatty waste and also to show a link between biodegradability and bio-availability. The anaerobic digestion of raw waste, saponified waste and waste with a co-substrate was carried out in batch mode under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. The results showed little increase in the total volume of biogas, indicating a good biodegradability of the raw wastes. Mean biogas volume reached 1200 mL/g VS which represented more than 90% of the maximal theoretical biogas potential. Raw fatty wastes were slowly biodegraded whereas pretreated wastes showed improved initial reaction kinetics, indicating a better initial bio-availability, particularly for mesophilic runs. The effects observed for raw wastes with ethanol as co-substrate depended on the process temperature: in mesophilic conditions, an initial improvement was observed whereas in thermophilic conditions a significant decrease in biodegradability was observed.

Nano-layered TiO2 for effective bacterial disintegration of waste activated sludge and biogas production,"BACKGROUNDProper management of the huge amount of waste activated sludge generated during the conventional treatment of wastewater is nowadays a major environmental issue. Proper treatment of sludge needs huge investment and proper handling. To address this issue, the immobilized photocatalyst (TiO2) mediated exocellular fractionation of bacterial pretreatment for anaerobic digestion was utilized as a sludge treatment technique. RESULTTi was deposited on glass substrate by a DC spluttering technique, and a TiO2 layer was formed by annealing in oxygen atmosphere. This immobilized TiO2 efficiently extricated the extracellular components after 45 min by removing 99% of the total extractable extracellular polymeric substances. The exocellular fractionated bacterial pretreatment induced 20% of COD solubilization with methane generation of about 0.0217 g COD g(-1) COD d(-1), which was higher than the sludge without any treatment and sludge with bacterial pretreatment only. CONCLUSIONAn 8% increase in COD solubilization was achieved, which generated high quantities of methane. With the advantage of methane generation, the maximum profitable sludge reduction was obtained. Thin film deposition of TiO2 enables easy recovery of TiO2. The cost, energy, and solid balance analysis confirmed that this treatment method is field applicable.

Fungal pretreatment of yard trimmings for enhancement of methane yield from solid-state anaerobic digestion,"Yard trimmings were pretreated by Ceriporiopsis subvermispora, a white-rot fungus that selectively degrades lignin, to enhance methane production via solid-state anaerobic digestion. Effects of moisture content (MC), at 45%, 60%, and 75%, on the degradation of holocellulose and lignin in the fungal pretreatment step and on methane production in the digestion step were studied with comparison to the control group (autoclaved without inoculation) and raw yard trimmings. It was found that C. subvermispora had a high lignin degradation of 20.9% but limited cellulose degradation of 7.4% at 60% MC. Consequently, samples pretreated at 60% MC achieved the highest methane yield of 44.6 L/kg volatile solid (VS) in the digestion step, which was 106% and 154% higher than the control group (21.6 L/kg VS) and the raw yard trimmings (17.6 L/kg VS), respectively. The increase in methane production was probably caused by the degradation of lignin during the pretreatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Integrating microalgae tertiary treatment into activated sludge systems for energy and nutrients recovery from wastewater,"In this study, microalgae digestate and secondary effluent were used to grow microalgae in a tertiary wastewater treatment, and then, the biomass was co-digested for biogas generation. A 30 L closed-photobioreactor was used for microalgae cultivation. The biomass, mainly composed by Scenedesmus sp., reached and maintained a concentration of 1.1 gTSS/L during 30 days. A complete removal of N-NH4+ and P-PO43- and high nitrates and organic matter removals were achieved (58% N-NO3- and 70% COD) with 8 d of HRT. The potential biogas production of the cultivated microalgae was determined in batch tests. To improve their biodegradability, a novel method combining their co-digestion with activated sludge after a simultaneous autohydrolysis co-pretreatment was evaluated. After the co-pretreatment, the methane yield increased by 130%.

Enhancing Biogas Production from Anaerobically Digested Wheat Straw Through Ammonia Pretreatment,"Aqueous ammonia was used to pretreat wheat straw to improve biodegradability and provide nitrogen source for enhancing biogas production. Three doses of ammonia (2%, 4%, and 6%, dry matter) and three moisture contents (30%, 60%, and 80%, dry matter) were applied to pretreat wheat straw for 7 days. The pretreated wheat straws were anaerobically digested at three loading rates (50, 65, and 80 g . L-1) to produce biogas. The results indicated that the wheat straw pretreated with 80% moisture content and 4% ammonia achieved the highest methane yield of 199.7 ml . g(-1) (based on per unit volatile solids loaded), with shorter digestion time (T-80) of 25 days at the loading rate of 65 g . L-1 compared to untreated one. The main chemical compositions of wheat straw were also analyzed. The cellulose and hemicellulose contents were decomposed by 2%-20% and 26%-42%, respectively, while the lignin content was hardly removed, cold-water and hot-water extracts were increased by 4%-44%, and 12%-52%, respectively, for the ammonia-pretreated wheat straws at different moisture contents. The appropriate C/N ratio and decomposition of original chemical compositions into relatively readily biodegradable substances will improve the biodegradability and biogas yield.","Yang, DY; Pang, YZ; Yuan, HR; Chen, SL; Ma, JW; Yu, L; Li, XJ",wheat straw; anaerobic digestion; biogas; ammonia pretreatment; moisture content,2014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1004-9541(14)60075-6,Chemical,alkaline,aqueous ammonia soaking,lignocellulose,wheat,straw,,,,,,,,
Impacts of microwave pretreatments on the semi-continuous anaerobic digestion of dairy waste activated sludge,"Microwave (MW) irradiation is one of the new and possible methods used for pretreating the sludge. Following its use in different fields, this MW irradiation method has proved to be more appropriate in the field of environmental research. In this paper, we focused on the effects of MW irradiation at different intensities on solubilization, biodegradation and anaerobic digestion of sludge from the dairy sludge. The changes in the soluble fractions of the organic matter, the biogas yield, the methane content in the biogas were used as control parameters for evaluating the efficiency of the MW pretreatment. Additionally, the energetic efficiency was also examined. In terms of an energetic aspect, the most economical pretreatment of sludge was at 70% intensity for 12 min irradiation time. At this, COD solubilization, SS reduction and biogas production were found to be 18.6%, 14% and 35% higher than the control, respectively. Not only the increase in biogas production was investigated, excluding protein and carbohydrate hydrolysis was also performed successfully by this microwave pretreatment even at low irradiation energy input. Also, experiments were carried out in semi continuous anaerobic digesters, with 3.5 L working volume. Combining microwave pretreatment with anaerobic digestion led to 67%, 64% and 57% of SS reduction, VS reduction and biogas production higher than the control, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

With an increasing proportion of CG in the co-digestion experiment, CG10 showed higher methane production, while CG15 negatively affected the anaerobic digestion (AD) performance owing to propionic acid accumulation acidifying the reactors and inhibiting methanogen growth. As the pretreatments partially decomposed hard-to-degrade substances in advance, pretreated FW showed a stronger methane production ability compared with raw FW, especially using the HL method, which was significantly better than co-digestion.

Pilot-Scale Anaerobic Digestion of Pig Manure with Thermal Pretreatment: Stability Monitoring to Improve the Potential for Obtaining Methane,"Monitoring and controlling stability in anaerobic digestion (AD) systems are essential, since it allows to obtain information that helps to take corrective actions in case of deviations in the system and to guarantee a stable performance in the biogas production. In this work, a pilot-scale CSRT reactor (1 m(3)) was monitored during the anaerobic digestion of pig manure with thermal pretreatment (80 degrees C) operated at thermophilic temperature (45 degrees C). The ratio of the volatile organic acids (FOS) to the total inorganic carbonate (TAC) and the pH were the indicators used during the monitoring process to identify deviations in the AD system. Additionally, alkaline solution NaOH (98%) was applied to counteract pH deviations and maintain stability. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biogas composition were measured during the AD process. It was found that during the AD process, the FOS/TAC was between the range of 0.5 and 1. The results revealed that, in the anaerobic digestion of pig manure with thermal pretreatment, the pH was kept stable in the range of 6.7-7.4 since no medium acidification occurred. Additionally, the tendency of the chemical oxygen demand decreased from the 10th day of operation, product of the favorable enzymatic activity of the microorganisms, reflected in the stable production of biogas (69% CH4). Finally, it is concluded that thermophilic AD of pig manure with thermal pretreatment is a good option when it is carried out efficiently by employing an adequate energetic integration.","Vanegas, M; Romani, F; Jimenez, M",anaerobic digestion; pig manure; biogas; thermal pretreatment; monitoring stability,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr10081602,Physical,thermal,,manure,pig,,,,,,,,,
Increased biogas production from wheat straw by chemical pretreatments,"This work investigated the effect of three different chemical pretreatment methods on the biogas production from the anaerobic digestion of wheat straw. The lignocellulosic material was separately pretreated using i) the organic solvent N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMMO) at 120 degrees C for 3 h, ii) the organosolv method, employing ethanol as the organic solvent at 180 degrees C for 1 h and iii) using an alkaline pretreatment with NaOH at 30 degrees C for 24 h. All the pretreatments were effective in increasing the biomethane production yield of wheat straw. In particular, the cumulative biomethane production yield of 274 mL CH4/g VS obtained with the untreated feedstock was enhanced by 11% by the NMMO pretreatment and by 15% by both the organosolv and alkaline pretreatment. The three pretreatment methods had a different impact on the chemical composition of the straw. NMMO hardly changed the amount of carbohydrates and lignin present in the original feedstock. Organosolv had a major impact on dissolving the hemicellulose component, whereas the alkaline pretreatment was the most effective in removing the lignin fraction. In addition to the increased biogas yields, the applied pretreatments enhanced the kinetics of biomethane production. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Hydrothermal pretreatment for biogas production from anaerobic digestion of antibiotic mycelial residue,"This paper aims at investigating the effect of hydrothermal pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of antibiotic mycelial residue (AMR) for biogas production based on batch laboratory experiments. The pretreatment temperature and time varied from 80 to 180 degrees C and from 0 to 60 min, respectively. The results show that the hydrothermal pretreatment could degrade the organic particulates in AMR into soluble and even small-molecule substances to significantly improve the anaerobic digestibility of AMR and greatly facilitate biogas production. The biogas yield increased with increasing pretreatment temperature and time when the temperature was not higher than 120 degrees C, and a higher temperature did not significantly facilitate the biogas production and even lead to a lower biogas yield, especially when the pretreatment temperature time was excessively long. The hydrothermal pretreatment at 120 degrees C for 60 min gave the best digestion performance, and the corresponding methane and biogas yields reached 290 and 446 ml/g VS, respectively.

Co-ensiling of straw with sugar beet leaves increases the methane yield from straw,"This study examined the effect of co-ensiling of wheat straw and sugar beet leaves on the biochemical methane potential (BMP) by both lab-scale and pilot-scale co-ensiling. BMP was increased by co-ensiling, and the increase ranged from 19 to 34% after 9 months of co-ensiling in lab-scale and from 18 to 32% after 6 months of co-ensiling in pilot-scale. No effluent run-off was found through pilot-scale co-ensiling and there was a mass loss of only 0.1%. The study demonstrates that co-ensiling of straw and green biomass has potential as biological pretreatment and for avoiding effluent run-off from pure beet leave silage.","Larsen, SU; Hjort-Gregersen, K; Vazifehkhoran, AH; Triolo, JM",Biological pretreatment; Biochemical methane potential; Anaerobic digestion; Silage; Biodegradability; Biogas,2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.08.117,Biological,anaerobic,ensilage,codigestion,wheat straw+beet leaves,,,,,,,,,
Enhancement of methane production from sunflower oil cakes by dilute acid pretreatment,"The conversion of sunflower oil cake (SOC) into methane by mesophilic anaerobic digestion was the object of this study. The effect of a combined dilute acid-thermal pretreatment (acid concentration and temperature) on solubilisation and methane potential was investigated using a central composite design (CCD). For temperatures up to 170 degrees C, solubilisation of each parameter (total organic carbon, sugars and proteins) increased with the severity of the pretreatment (high temperature and high acid concentration). Methane production was higher for pre-treated samples than for the untreated samples (195 mL CH4/VS). The highest yield (302 +/- 10 mL CH4/gVS) was obtained after acid pretreatment at 170 degrees C. At this temperature, acid concentrations lower than 1% had no significant impact on methane production in comparison to thermal treatment alone. The volume of methane produced by the soluble fraction reached more than 60% of total methane production. An increase in methane production was correlated to the concentration of organic carbon in the liquid phase of samples pretreated at 130-170 degrees C with acid.

Anaerobic digestion of rice straw pretreatment liquor without detoxification for continuous biogas production using a 100 L internal circulation reactor,"The production of biogas from lignocellulose by anaerobic digestion (AD) has attracted much attention recently. However, the over-acidification phenomenon and low biogas yield often occur during the AD of lignocellulose. In this work, the liquid-state fermentation mode using pretreatment liquor from dilute acid treated rice straw without detoxification for continuous biogas production in a 100 L internal circulation reactor was studied. The highest biogas yield reached 0.66 m(3)/kg CODconsumption while the methane yield was 0.38 m(3)/kg CODconsumption. The pH values of outlet were maintained at 6.9-7.4, and even the inlet pH values were lower than 6.0. Furthermore, from the second day to the end of fermentation, the COD removal rates were more than 90%, even though the inlet COD was close to 20000 mg/L. The organic substances from acid pretreated rice straw were efficiently degraded by AD, which was confirmed by substrate metabolism analysis. These results indicated that the whole fermentation process of AD was very stable and showed great potential for industrial application.","Li, HL; Wang, C; Chen, XF; Xiong, L; Guo, HJ; Yao, SM; Wang, MK; Chen, XD; Huang, C",Anaerobic digestion; Rice straw; Biogas production; Pretreatment liquor; IC reactor,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.131450,Chemical,acidic,,lignocellulose,rice,straw,,,,,,,,

Further analysis indicated that low-temperature alkaline TPT was significantly less energy-consumption compared to only TPT, at cost of small amounts of alkali.

Scaling-Up the Anaerobic Digestion of Pretreated Microalgal Biomass within a Water Resource Recovery Facility,"Microalgae-based wastewater treatment plants are low-cost alternatives for recovering nutrients from contaminated effluents through microalgal biomass, which may be subsequently processed into valuable bioproducts and bioenergy. Anaerobic digestion for biogas and biomethane production is the most straightforward and applicable technology for bioenergy recovery. However, pretreatment techniques may be needed to enhance the anaerobic biodegradability of microalgae. To date, very few full-scale systems have been put through, due to acknowledged bottlenecks such as low biomass concentration after conventional harvesting and inefficient processing into valuable products. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anaerobic digestion of pretreated microalgal biomass in a demonstration-scale microalgae biorefinery, and to compare the results obtained with previous research conducted at lab-scale, in order to assess the scalability of this bioprocess. In the lab-scale experiments, real municipal wastewater was treated in high rate algal ponds (2 x 0.47 m(3)), and harvested microalgal biomass was thickened and digested to produce biogas. It was observed how the methane yield increased by 67% after implementing a thermal pretreatment step (at 75 degrees C for 10 h), and therefore the very same pretreatment was applied in the demonstration-scale study. In this case, agricultural runoff was treated in semi-closed tubular photobioreactors (3 x 11.7 m(3)), and harvested microalgal biomass was thickened and thermally pretreated before undergoing the anaerobic digestion to produce biogas. The results showed a VS removal of 70% in the reactor and a methane yield up to 0.24 L CH4/g VS, which were similar to the lab-scale results. Furthermore, photosynthetic biogas upgrading led to the production of biomethane, while the digestate was treated in a constructed wetland to obtain a biofertilizer. In this way, the demonstration-scale plant evidenced the feasibility of recovering resources (biomethane and biofertilizer) from agricultural runoff using microalgae-based systems coupled with anaerobic digestion of the microalgal biomass.","Diez-Montero, R; Vassalle, L; Passos, F; Ortiz, A; Garcia-Galan, MJ; Garcia, J; Ferrer, I",agricultural runoff; anaerobic digestion; biogas; biomethane; biorefinery; microalgae; photobioreactor; pretreatment; wastewater,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en13205484,Physical,thermal,,micro-algae,microalgae,,,,,,,,,

Microbial Pretreatment of Chicken Feather and Its Co-digestion With Rice Husk and Green Grocery Waste for Enhanced Biogas Production,"To utilize wastes and residues sustainably and excellently, there is a need to fend for efficient methods and resources for biogas production. Use of poultry waste for biogas production represents one of the most important routes toward reaching global renewable energy targets. The current study involves microbial pretreatment of chicken feather waste, followed by its co-digestion with rice husk and green grocery waste in batch and continuous reactors, respectively. Microbial pretreatment of chicken feathers by keratinase secreting Pseudomonas aeruginosa was an effective and eco-friendly approach to make its recalcitrant structure available as a raw substrate for biogas production. The current study also addressed the enhancement and stability of anaerobic digestion by co-digestion. Results demonstrated that biogas production was increased by microbial pretreatment of chicken feathers and that the percentage increase in biogas yield was 1.1% in microbialy pretreated feathers compared to mono-digestion (non-pretreated feathers) in batch fermentation. The highest yield of biogas was obtained in a batch reactor having co-digestion of pretreated rice husk and microbial pretreated chicken feathers. The co-digestion of chicken feathers hydrolysate with green grocery waste in continuous fermentation mode has also enhanced the biogas yield as compared to average of mono-digestion (chicken feather hydrolysate and green grocery waste) and, therefore, improve the efficiency of the overall process.","Saba, M; Khan, A; Ali, H; Bibi, A; Gul, Z; Khan, A; Rehman, MMU; Badshah, M; Hasan, F; Shah, AA; Khan, S",anaerobic digestion; biogas; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; microbial pretreatment; chicken feather waste,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.792426,Biological,bacterial,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,other,feather,chicken,83,68.89,,,,,,
High-Titer Methane from Organosolv-Pretreated Spruce and Birch,"The negative impact of fossil fuels and the increased demand for renewable energy sources has led to the use of novel raw material sources. Lignocellulosic biomass could serve as a possible raw material for anaerobic digestion and production of biogas. This work is aimed at using forest biomass, both softwood (spruce) and hardwood (birch), as a raw material for anaerobic digestion. We examined the effect of different operational conditions for the organosolv pretreatment (ethanol content, duration of treatment, and addition of acid catalyst) on the methane yield. In addition, we investigated the effect of addition of cellulolytic enzymes during the digestion. We found that inclusion of an acid catalyst during organosolv pretreatment improved the yields from spruce, but it did not affect the yields from birch. Shorter duration of treatment was advantageous with both materials. Methane yields from spruce were higher with lower ethanol content whereas higher ethanol content was more beneficial for birch. The highest yields obtained were 185 mL CH4/g VS from spruce and 259.9 mL CH4/g VS from birch. Addition of cellulolytic enzymes improved these yields to 266.6 mL CH4/g VS and 284.2 mL CH4/g VS, respectively.","Matsakas, L; Nitsos, C; Voros, D; Rova, U; Christakopoulos, P",biogas; methane; lignocellulosic biomass; organosolv pretreatment; anaerobic digestion; birch; spruce,2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en10030263,Chemical,solvent,organosolv ethanol,wood,woodchips,"spruce,birch",,,,,,,,

Mechanical pretreatment of waste paper for biogas production,"In the anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic materials such as waste paper, the accessibility of microorganisms to the fermentable sugars is restricted by their complex structure. A mechanical pretreatment with a Hollander beater was assessed in order to reduce the biomass particle size and to increase the feedstock' specific surface area available to the microorganisms, and therefore improve the biogas yield. Pretreatment of paper waste for 60 min improves the methane yield by 21%, from a value of 210 ml/gVS corresponding to untreated paper waste to 254 ml/gVS. 30 min pretreatment have no significant effect on the methane yield. A response surface methodology was used to evaluate the effect of the beating time and feedstock/inoculum ratio on the methane yield. An optimum methane yield of 253 ml/gVS was achieved at 55 min of beating pretreatment and a F/I ratio of 0.3. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Enhancement of biogas production from organic fraction of municipal solid waste using acid pretreatment,"Anaerobic digestion of organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) is a potential and economic technique for harnessing bioenergy from Indian municipal solid waste. Pretreatment before anaerobic digestion has been known to improve biodegradability of substrate and enhance biogas production. In this study, the effectiveness of acid pretreatment in enhancing the hydrolysis of complex organic matter and ensuing biogas generation from OFMSW was studied using one strong and one weak acid. Acid pretreatment (pH 6-pH 1) of OFMSW was carried out using hydrochloric acid (HCl) and acetic acid (CH3COOH) for 24 h before batch anaerobic digestion assays with cow dung as inoculum. Increase in biogas yield ranged between 13.2 and 28.9% as compared to untreated OFMSW after pretreatment with HCl, whereas the same varied between 8.2 and 16% in case of CH3COOH pretreatment. The highest biogas yield (389.4 ml/gVS) with methane content of 68.3% was obtained after pretreatment with HCl at pH 3, whereas for CH3COOH, the highest yield (350.2 ml/gVS) with 67.4% methane was observed after pretreatment at pH 1. OFMSW characteristics after each pretreatment step and their variation during the course of anaerobic digestion were also studied. An economic evaluation of all pretreatment scenarios was performed; out of which, pretreatment of OFMSW with HCl at pH 4-pH 6 yielded positive results in terms of net revenue gains.","Dasgupta, A; Chandel, MK",Acid pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Methane; Municipal solid waste; India,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-03213-z,Chemical,acidic,,ofmsw,municipal solid waste,,46,39,,,,8.5,5.5,4.9
Can coffee grounds be considered as a potential for green energy production?,"Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world Over 50% of this mass is discarded after use, becoming a significant waste source known as spent coffee grounds (SCG). SCG usage as a raw material for biogas production emerges with great potential. In this study, we investigated the biochemical composition of SCG and its potential as a green energy source. We demonstrated that SCG can produce 0.1559 Nm(3) CH4 / kg COD and that the extraction of polyphenols from the substrates can increase this production by almost 100%. In contrast, acid treatment using HCl showed no effect on gas production from this biomass.","El Achkar, JH; Baydoun, A; Salameh, D; Louka, N; Hobaika, Z; Maroun, RG",Spent coffee grounds; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas production; Polyphenols; Acid pretreatment,2018,0,Chemical,acidic,,lignocellulose,coffea,ground,,,,,,,,
Effect of biological pretreatments in enhancing corn straw biogas production,"A biological pretreatment with new complex microbial agents was used to pretreat corn straw at ambient temperature (about 20 degrees C) to improve its biodegradability and anaerobic biogas production. A complex microbial agent dose of 0.01% (w/w) and pretreatment time of 15 days were appropriate for biological pretreatment. These treatment conditions resulted in 33.07% more total biogas yield, 75.57% more methane yield, and 34.6% shorter technical digestion time compared with the untreated sample. Analyses of chemical compositions showed 5.81-25.10% reductions in total lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose contents, and 27.19-80.71% increases in hot-water extractives; these changes contributed to the enhancement of biogas production. Biological pretreatment could be an effective method for improving biodegradability and enhancing the highly efficient biological conversion of corn straw into bioenergy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Pretreatment of energy crops with sodium hydroxide and cellulolytic enzymes to increase biogas production,This work presents the influence of alkali pretreatment on the enzymatic hydrolysis and efficiency of anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic biomass pretreated both in a one- (chemical or enzymatic) and two-step (chemical and enzymatic) process. In this study two species of energy crops were used Miscanthus giganteus and Sida hermaphrodita. The aim of this work was to compare biogas production and methane yield during fermentation of pretreated and untreated energy crops. The results show that alkali pretreatment is necessary for the effective biogas generation from plant material due to high delignification level and significant hemicellulose degradation. The two-step hydrolysis process consisting on the alkali and enzymatic step leads to the release of high concentrations of glucose (about 20 g L-1).

Biogas production from ensiled meadow grass; effect of mechanical pretreatments and rapid determination of substrate biodegradability via physicochemical methods,"As the biogas sector is rapidly expanding, there is an increasing need in finding new alternative feedstock to biogas plants. Meadow grass can be a suitable co-substrate and if ensiled it can be supplied to biogas plants continuously throughout the year. Nevertheless, this substrate is quite recalcitrant and therefore efficient pretreatment is needed to permit easy access of microbes to the degradable components. In this study, different mechanical pretreatment methods were applied on ensiled meadow grass to investigate their effect on biomass biodegradability. All the tested pretreatments increased the methane productivity and the increase ranged from 8% to 25%. The best mechanical pretreatment was the usage of two coarse mesh grating plates. Additionally, simple analytical methods were conducted to investigate the possibility of rapidly determining the methane yield of meadow grass. Among the methods, electrical conductivity test showed the most promising calibration statistics (R-2 = 0.68). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Secondly, semi-continuous process performance was studied in a lab-scale semi-continuous anaerobic reactor (5 L), with 4 L working volume. With three operated SRTs, the SRT of 15 days was found to be most appropriate for economic operation of the reactor. Combining pretreatment with anaerobic digestion led to 80.5%, 117% and 90.4% of TS, SS and VS reduction respectively, with an improvement of 103% in biogas production. Thus, low temperature thermo-chemical can play an important role in reducing sludge production. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Enhancement of biogas production from sunnhemp using alkaline pretreatment,"This study investigates enhancing the biogas production of sunnhemp by pretreatment, before the anaerobic digestion and co-digestion processes, to address the complex and recalcitrant structure of the plant. Fresh sunnhemp harvested at a cutting interval of 50 days is used in the study. Five systems (each with a 5 litre useable volume) are operated semi-continuously with five different ratios of the feedstock by feeding separate feedstocks every five days with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 40 days. The system operates at room temperature (30 degrees C). The study uses sunnhemp as 20% of the feedstock and also considers sunnhemp mixed with cow manure at different ratios, with the weighed sunnhemp being pretreated with dilute sodium hydroxide. Pretreatment of sunnhemp before digestion produces a methane (CH4) yield 89% greater than that of the untreated sunnhemp. It requires 3.597 kg of dry sunnhemp to produce 1 m3 of CH4 and the annual CH4 yield per hectare is 19,015 m3. In the pretreatment of sunnhemp before co-digestion, the increased CH4 yield depends on the amount of pretreated sunnhemp in the feedstocks. However, the %CH4, the CH4 production level and the system stability depend on the optimal ratio of the sunnhemp to cow manure. The initially prepared sunnhemp to cow manure ratio is recommended at 10 g:10 gin 80 mL of water. At this ratio, the %CH4 and the CH4 yield are 53.84% and 313 kg chemical oxygen demand (COD) removed, respectively, and the COD removal efficiency is 56.4%. Sunnhemp has high potential and it is worth pretreating before producing biogas. Using sunnhemp to produce biogas is recommended to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate global warming.

Enzymatic and Hydrothermal Pretreatment of Newly Isolated Spirulina subsalsa BGLR6 Biomass for Enhanced Biogas Production,"The complex structure and biochemical composition of the cell wall of microalgae impede their anaerobic digestion. To enhance the microalgae anaerobic biodegradability, various pretreatment approaches have been utilized. In this study, the enzyme and hydrothermal pretreatment methods were evaluated for microalgal biomass pretreatment and biogas yield. The optical and scanning electron microscopy along with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis confirmed the efficient action of both the pretreatment methods. The hydrothermal pretreatment resulted in more structural changes, though the increase in enzymatic concentration was also found to have a pronounced effect on both structural and chemical changes. The FTIR spectra determined that mostly the protein and carbohydrate structures of the microalgal cells were affected. Further upon quantitative analysis, it was observed that 10% dose (w/w) for 24 h of exposure time released significantly more soluble chemical oxygen demand compared to others. The multi-enzyme 10% dose for 24 h resulted in significantly higher biogas production potential (P) of 768.92 mL g(-1) VS at a maximum biogas production rate (R-m) of 32.16 mL g(-1) d(-1) with a very short lag phase (lambda) of 0.09 days at the end of 30 days, in comparison to untreated and other pretretment conditions in this study.

Techno-economic evaluation of ultrasound and thermal pretreatments for enhanced anaerobic digestion of municipal waste activated sludge,"To enhance the anaerobic digestion of municipal waste-activated sludge (WAS), ultrasound, thermal, and ultrasound + thermal (combined) pretreatments were conducted using three ultrasound specific energy inputs (1000, 5000, and 10,000 kJ/kg TSS) and three thermal pretreatment temperatures (50, 70 and 90 degrees C).

Effect of the ozonation pretreatment on biogas production from waste activated sludge of tehran wastewater treatment plant,"In this study, the ozonation impact on anaerobic digestion of wasted thickened activated sludge of Tehran wastewater treatment plant has been investigated. Regarding that, the thickened activated sludge, a final solid waste of treatment plants, was subjected to ozonation pretreatment to evaluate its characteristics. Three major sludge characteristics were considered for investigating ozonation effects on anaerobic digestion. A comparison of two different ozone doses, i.e., 0.05 and 0.1 gO(3) g(-1)TS was performed for short-term (10 days) and long-term (30 days) sludge retention times. Furthermore, biogas production, sludge composition, dewaterability, and energy balancing, were studied during the periods mentioned above. The results show that the lower ozone dose has an acceptable performance in a short-term operation for all parameters except energy balance which was negative in all the scenarios. Higher ozone dosage not only decreased biogas production and volatile solids reduction but also significantly increased the energy demand of the system. In addition, a longer retention time reduced the effectiveness of the ozone pretreatment during that time. Eventually, the feasibility of ozone pretreatment capacity for sustainable management of different sludge from economic and technological perspectives can be evaluated by further assessing this case study.","Hodaei, M; Ghasemi, S; Khosravi, A; Vossoughi, M",Anaerobic digestion; Biogas production; Dewatering; Ozonation pretreatment; Thickened activated sludge,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2021.106198,Chemical,oxidizer,ozone,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Assessment of the relationship between solubilization and biogas production on anaerobic digestion of pretreated lipid-extracted microalgae waste,"It is commonly known that the pretreatment of complex substrates yields higher biogas production in anaerobic digestion (AD) by improving hydrolysis. However, it is still questioned whether all solubilized fractions after pretreatment can be used for CH4 production during AD. In this study, the relationship between increased solubilization and AD efficiency in response to different pretreatment conditions of lipid-extracted microalgae waste (LEMW) was investigated. The individual pretreatment (acid and ultrasonic) and combined pretreatment were applied to assess the solubilization of LEMW. A biochemical methane potential (BMP) test was subsequently performed to determine the AD efficiency. Combined pretreatment of LEMW (60 min of irradiation + pH 1) showed the highest performance, achieving CH4 production of 1245 +/- 28 mL CH4/L with increased solubilization of 50.4%. However, it was found that increased solubilization did not proportionally increase CH4 productivity. The assessment of the origin of produced CH4 through biomass fractionation supports this finding in that the soluble fraction that does not contribute to CH4 production increased at more severe pretreatment conditions.","Sposob, M; Kim, DH; Yun, GS; Yun, YM",Anaerobic digestion; Biogas production; Lipid-extracted microalgae waste; Pretreatment; Solubilization,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.105702,Chemical,acidic,,micro-algae,chlorella ,,,,,,,,,

Effect of Autoclave Pretreatment on Biogas Production through Anaerobic Digestion of Green Algae,"Anaerobic Digestion (AD) is one of the most widely used methods in the field of sustainable bioenergy production from various feedstock. One such feedstock is algae waste which has become an increasingly serious environmental problem. AD of algal biomass is hindered by the presence of resistant cell walls; hence a pretreatment step is usually required to decompose the cell wall structure. This study uses green algae (Enteromorpha) and anaerobic sludge as raw materials to explore the impact of autoclave (AC) pretreatment on biogas production. AC pretreatment was performed at 120 degrees C and 80 degrees C. The cumulative biogas production of the 120 degrees C AC pretreatment, 80 degrees C AC pretreatment and control group were 600 mL, 450 mL and 400 mL, respectively. The results showed that AC pretreatment improved the biodegradability of biomass as 120 degrees C AC pretreatment group achieved higher degradation rate of cells (95.99 %). The energy evaluation showed that the net energy ratio of the 120 degrees C AC pretreatment group was 1.07, indicating high overall energy gain via AD process. The experimental data is further modeled by using Modified Gompertz Model (MGM) and Logistic Function Model (LFM). To check the applicability of better model for this AD process, an Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) test was performed.

Exergy analyses of biogas production from microalgae biomass via anaerobic digestion,"Biogas production from microalgae biomass without pretreatment and with hydrothermal pretreatment involve the energy with different quality and quantity, which makes it complex to evaluate thermodynamic performance. In this paper, exergy analyses were conducted in biogas production from microalgae biomass without pretreatment, with hydrothermal pretreatment, and with solar-driven hydrothermal pretreatment. The results showed that the materials and energy flow affected exergy efficiency in biogas production from microalgae biomass. The biogas production from microalgae biomass with solar-driven hydrothermal pretreatment achieved the highest exergy efficiency (40.85%), compared with that without pretreatment (26.2%) and with hydrothermal pretreatment (35.98%). In addition, the maximum exergy loss was caused by biogas residue, which accounted for 60.58%, 38.54%, and 35.13% of overall exergy input in biogas production from microalgae biomass without pretreatment, with hydrothermal pretreatment, and with solar-driven hydrothermal pretreatment, respectively.

Effect of steam explosion on physicochemical properties of waste activated sludge and the performance of anaerobic digestion,"The effect of steam explosion on physicochemical properties of sludge and the performance of anaerobic digestion (AD) was investigated. The steam explosion was conducted under different combinations of temperature and time, ranging 151-198 degrees C and 4-12 min respectively. The capillary suction time (CST) and viscosity of the sludge was increased with particle size decreased by improved hydrolysis temperature and prolonged hydrolysis time. The best sludge solubilization achieved was 41.3% under pretreatment condition of 198 degrees C and 4 min. Biogas production was enhanced with the improved sludge solubilization, and a linear correlation was found between biogas production and the severity factor (logR(0)) of steam explosion. However, the biogas productivity was reduced when the logR(0) was increased from 3.79 to 3.96, probably owing to the generation of refractory organics during the high severity pretreatment. The temperature of 198 degrees C and the time of 8 min were the recommended operation parameters of steam explosion pretreatment for sludge AD, which could improve biogas production by 99.7 mL/g VSfed. The pH and NH4+-N during sludge AD was increased by steam explosion pretreatment; however, no inhibition on biogas production was observed.","Zhang, Y; Han, P; Liu, H; Zhang, LH; Liu, HB; Fu, B",anaerobic digestion; biogas production; pretreatment; steam explosion; waste activated sludge,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2018.227,Physical,thermal,steam explosion,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,

Enhanced Biogas Yield of Chinese Herbal Medicine Extraction Residue by Hydrothermal Pretreatment,"Chinese herbal medicine extraction residue (CHER) is a special organic waste produced in China. Because of the high content of lignocelluloses, CHER have a weak bioconversion efficiency for bio-products production. This study investigates the effect of a hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP, 140 to 220 degrees C, 15 min) on the organic matter solubilisation, biochemical methane potential, and methanation kinetics of CHER during anaerobic digestion (AD). The AD test was conducted with 5 g/L total solid at 35 degrees C for 30 d. The results showed that the HTP clearly improved the solubilisation of CHER, and the obtained soluble COD (%) reached over 30% (only 4.5% in untreated). Acetic acid, xylose, and glucose were found to be the main products in the hydrolysate. The methane yield and methanation speed of the treated CHER were also enhanced. The highest methane yield of 306 mL/g volatile solid was achieved at a HTP temperature of 180 degrees C, while the untreated control was only 175 mL/g VS. Moreover, a carbonisation phenomenon was observed at HTP temperatures over 200 degrees C, which resulted in a loss of organic matter and methane yield.","Wang, M; Zhang, YL; Yan, SP; Yi, BJ; Niu, WJ; Yuan, QX",Chinese herb-extraction residue; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Methanation kinetics; Biogas,2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.15376/biores.12.3.4627-4638,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,lignocellulose,herbs,leaves,,,,,,,,
Conventional heating vs. microwave sludge pretreatment comparison under identical heating/cooling profiles for thermophilic advanced anaerobic digestion,"This research evaluates whether there is any advantage of selecting one of the thermal methods of sludge pretreatment, conventional heating (CH) and microwave hydrolysis (MW), over another to enhance municipal sludge disintegration and performance of thermophilic anaerobic digestion (AD). For this purpose, a custom-built CH system simulating MW hydrolysis under identical heating and cooling profiles was used. The effects of three main pretreatment parameters including pretreatment method (CH and MW), heating ramp rate (3, 6 and 11 degrees C/min) and final temperature (80, 120 and 160 degrees C) on sludge solubilization and performance of thermophilic batch AD were evaluated. The effects of CH and MW hydrolysis were observed to be similar for sludge disintegration and digester performance (p-value > 0.05), while the effects of final temperature and heating ramp rate were proven to be different (p-value < 0.05). According to the results, it is essential to apply MW and CH pretreatments under identical experimental condition for an unbiased comparison which supports the findings of the author's earlier study under mesophilic condition. Failing to address this issue explains the significant inconsistency observed among the findings of the previous CH vs. MW comparison studies that were unable to implement identical thermal profiles (between CH and MW) during sludge pretreatment. In comparison with mesophilic AD, thermophilic AD revealed lower biodegradation rate constant at the highest pretreatment temperature tested (160 degrees C), suggesting its higher sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of thermal pretreatment at the elevated temperatures.

In this study, continuous anaerobic digestion (AD) of manure mixed with optimally AAS-treated manure fibers was compared to the AD of manure mixed with untreated manure fibers. Due to lab-scale pumping restrictions, the ratio of AAS-optimally treated manure fibers to manure was only 1/3 on a total solids (TS) basis. However, the biogas productivity and methane yield were improved by 17% and 38%, respectively, also confirming the predictions from a simplified 1st order hydrolysis model based on batch experiments. Furthermore, an improved reduction efficiency of major organic components was observed for the digester processing AAS-treated manure fibers compared to the non-treated one (e.g., 42% increased reduction for cellulose fraction). A preliminary techno-economic analysis of the proposed process showed that mixing raw manure with AAS manure fibers in large-scale digesters could result in a 72% increase of revenue compared to the AD of manure mixed with untreated fibers and 135% increase compared to that of solely manure.","Lymperatou, A; Rasmussen, NB; Gavala, HN; Skiadas, IV",manure; anaerobic digestion; ammonia pretreatment; manure fibers; techno-economic analysis; CSTR; aqueous ammonia soaking; biogas; methane; continuous anaerobic digestion,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14030787,Chemical,alkaline,aqueous ammonia soaking,manure,swine,,2.2,1.5,,,,12,9,16
Closing ammonia loop in efficient biogas production: Recycling ammonia pretreatment of wheat straw,"We propose an integrated system for simultaneous ammonia recovery, ammonia pretreatment, biogas upgrading, and fertiliser production in biogas production. Ammonia stripping and absorbing played an important role as they significantly affected the ammonia recovery and biogas upgrading performance. Ammonia stripping with biogas was used to remove ammonia from biogas slurry at various conditions. The ammonia removal efficiency reached 99.30% at 10% CO2 content, 90 degrees C and 6 h stripping time. Ammonia absorption of ammonia-bearing biogas achieved crystalline ammonium and biogas upgrading. The obtained crystalline ammonium was used for recovering ammonia. The ammonia pretreatment and anaerobic digestion results showed that wheat straw pretreated with 0.70% ammonia concentration and 105 degrees C obtained the highest biogas yield of 538.1 mL g(-1), which was 31.9% higher than untreated wheat straw. The process in this study shows a great potential in biogas production by recycling ammonia for pretreatment of feedstocks and biogas purification associated with producing fertilisers.

Solid-State Anaerobic Digestion for Methane Production from Corn Stalks with Stack-Pretreated,"Microbial pretreatment was applied to enhance biogas production from corn stover through solid-state anaerobic digestion, but the price of microbial strains is high. The objective of this study was to find the effects on biogas production by the naturally microbial pretreatment method. The highest cumulative biogas yield for 60-day solid-state anaerobic digestion was obtained in B group (the pretreated corn straws with cow dung), which was 19.6% higher than that of the untreated samples. The D group (the pretreated corn straws with the sludge) cumulative biogas yield for 60-day solid-state anaerobic digestion was obtained, which was 18.87% higher than that of the untreted samples. The biogas of D group increased to the range of 55%similar to 60% methane content, while B group with the range of 75%similar to 80%.The results indicated that the pretreated corn straws mixing cow manure can improve both the biogas production yield and the content of methane in CH4.","Zhou, SX; Dong, YP; Zhang, YL",Anaerobic digestion Solid-state; Corn stover; Stack-pretreated; Biogas production yield,2012,http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.697-698.326,Biological,biological active substrate,"manure,digestate",lignocellulose,corn,stalk,,,,,,,,
Enhancing anaerobic biogasification of corn stover through wet state NaOH pretreatment,"A new method of wet state (WS) sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was advanced to pretreat corn stover for enhancing biogas production. The results showed that 88% moisture content, 3-day treatment time and ambient temperature (20,C) was appropriate for WS NaOH pretreatment. The NaOH dose of 2% and the loading rate of 65 g/L were found to be optimal in terms of 72.9% more total biogas production, 73.4% more methane yield, and 34.6% shorter technical digestion time, as compared to the untreated one. WS pretreatment used 86% shorter treatment time and 66.7% less NaOH dose than solid state one. The analyses of chemical compositions and chemical structures showed that 9.3-19.1% reduction of the contents of total Lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose (LCH), and 27.1-77.1% increase of hot-water extractives contributed to the enhancement of biogas production. WS NaOH pretreatment could be one of cost-effective methods for high efficient biological conversion of corn stover into bioenergy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Effect of hydrothermal pretreatment severity on the pretreatment characteristics and anaerobic digestion performance of corn stover,"The pretreatment characteristics and anaerobic digestion (AD) performance of corn stover were investigated at different hydrothermal pretreatment (HP) severity levels. The pretreatment of corn stover with and without ammonia was performed at different temperatures (100, 150, and 200 degrees C) and with a holding time of 5-30 mins. Results showed that after HP, the highest volatile fatty acid (VFAs) concentration was 10533.94 mg/L at a HP severity of 7.27, which was 1.72-3.35 times greater than those of others HP severity levels. Similarly, the highest removal rates of hemicellulose and lignin were 95.41% and 13.85% for HP severity levels of 6.81 and 1.98, respectively. The maximum biogas and methane increasing yield at 100 degrees C holding 30 min without ammonia were 16.26% and 22.74% greater than that of the untreated, respectively. These results suggest that an appropriate HP intensity can promote biogas production.","Song, XC; Wachemo, AC; Zhang, L; Bai, TQ; Li, XJ; Zuo, XY; Yuan, HR",Corn stover; Hydrothermal pretreatment (HP); HP severity; Anaerobic digestion (AD); Biogas,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.121646,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,lignocellulose,corn,stover,95,87,40,0.7,57,,,
Enhancement of biogas production efficiency using appropriate low-temperature pretreatments of municipal treatment plants' excess sludge,"Excess sludge in municipal plants normally contains high amounts of organic compounds (chemical oxygen demand [COD] of about 60,000 mg/L) and is capable of producing biogas. Anaerobic digestion is one of current methods to produce biogas. Municipal treatment plants' excess sludge contains high amounts of microbial cells with robust walls which inhibit microorganisms' access to the cells' organic content. This decreases biogas production efficiency as well as prolongs the time of anaerobic digestion process.

Enhancing the anaerobic digestion potential of dairy waste activated sludge by two step sono-alkalization pretreatment,"High efficiency resource recovery from dairy waste activated sludge (WAS) has been a focus of attention. An investigation into the influence of two step sono-alkalization pretreatment (using different alkaline agents, pH and sonic reaction times) on sludge reduction potential in a semi-continuous anaerobic reactor was performed for the first time in literature. Firstly, effect of sludge pretreatment was evaluated by COD solubilization, suspended solids reduction and biogas production. At optimized condition (4172 kJ/kg TS of supplied energy for NaOH - pH 10), COD solubilization, suspended solids reduction and biogas production was 59%, 46% and 80% higher than control. In order to clearly describe the hydrolysis of waste activated sludge during sono-alkalization pretreatment by a two step process, concentrations of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and bound extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) were also measured. Secondly, semi-continuous process performance was studied in a lab-scale semi-continuous anaerobic reactor (5 L), with 4 L working volume. With three operated SRTs, the SRT of 15 d was found to be most appropriate for economic operation of the reactor. Combining pretreatment with anaerobic digestion led to 58% and 62% of suspended solids and volatile solids reduction, respectively, with an improvement of 83% in biogas production.

Using a Pulsed Electric Field as a Pretreatment for Improved Biosolids Digestion and Methanogenesis,"Researchers tested using pulsed electric field (PEF) technology to enhance conversion of organic solids material in waste activated sludge (WAS) and pig manure to soluble and colloidal forms, which are more bioavailable for methane production during subsequent anaerobic digestion. Operating parameters were varied from 1.1 to 19.8 kWhr/m(3) to show the influence amount of treatment has on soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), small colloidal solids, and methane production via the biochemical methane potential test. When PEF treatment exceeded a threshold, which was approximately 10 kWhr/m(3), focused pulsed treatment solubilized approximately 10% of the total COD, increasing SCOD from as low as 20 mg/L to more than 1000 mg/L. The process also disrupted a larger portion of the volatile suspended solids (VSS) to form small colloids not measured by the VSS assay (between 0.2 and 1.2 mu m). The effects increased the biological methane potential of the samples significantly: by 80% for pig manure and 100% for WAS after 25 to 30 days. These results support the conclusion that PEF pretreatment before anaerobic digestion has the potential to significantly improve digester performance, resulting in added methane production and decreased residual biosolids.

Weak-base pretreatment to increase biomethane production from wheat straw,"Weak-base pretreatment of wheat straw was investigated for its ability to improve biomethane production. Anaerobic digestion (AD) was performed on wheat straw pretreated with 3%, 5%, or 7% Na(2)CO(3)as a weak base. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra demonstrated disruption of lignocellulosic structures by pretreatment. In the 5% Na(2)CO(3)treatment group, cellulose and hemicellulose were retained effectively, with efficient removal of lignin. The removal rates of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin were 27.9%, 20.4%, and 31.0%, respectively, after 5% Na(2)CO(3)pretreatment. The methane content (53.3-77.3%) was improved in the 5% Na(2)CO(3)treatment group, with maximum methane production (307.9 L/kg VS) that was 41.6% higher than that of the untreated sample. Cellulose and hemicelluloses were degraded 59.3% and 56.3% after AD. It took 20 days to reach 80% of the maximum cumulative methane production for the 5% Na(2)CO(3)pretreatment group, which was 4 days faster than the untreated group. These results indicate that 5% Na(2)CO(3)pretreatment improve the lignocellulose structure of wheat straw, allowing better biodegradability of wheat straw in AD for increased biogas production, enhanced methane content, and decreased digestion time.","Deng, YF; Qiu, YJ; Yao, YQ; Ayiania, M; Davaritouchaee, M",Anaerobic digestion; Lignocellulosic biomass; Sodium carbonate; Biogas; Pretreatment technology; Structural analysis,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09914-7,Chemical,alkaline,na2co3,lignocellulose,wheat,straw,99,86,35,0.5,66,25,14,7
Effect of high pressure homogenization on anaerobic digestion of the sludge pretreated by combined alkaline and high pressure homogenization,"In order to improve the efficiency of anaerobic sludge digestion, alkaline and high pressure homogenization (HPH) were combined to pre-treat the excess activated sludge. The effect of HPH operating parameters, including homogenization pressure and cycle number, on the performances of anaerobic sludge digestion was studied. The results demonstrated that the performances of sludge disintegration and anaerobic digestion were markedly enhanced by increasing the homogenization pressure. After pretreatment at a homogenization pressure of 60 MPa with one homogenization cycle combined with an alkaline dosage of 0.04 mol/L, the sludge TCOD, VS removal and cumulative bio-gas production in a mesophilic anaerobic digestion system increased by 24.68%, 18.95% and 95.81%, respectively, in comparison with that with the alkaline pretreatment alone. But the sludge disintegration and biogas production only slightly increased with the increase of homogenization cycle. Considering biogas production and energy-saving, the suitable homogenization operation was selected as homogenization pressure of 60 MPa with once cycle. Relationships between methane yield and sludge disintegration showed that the improved methane production was mainly attributed to the sludge disintegration resulted from combined sludge pretreatment.","Fang, W; Zhang, PY; Shang, R; Ye, J; Wu, Y; Zhang, HB; Liu, JB; Gou, XY; Zeng, GM; Zhou, SQ",Anaerobic digestion; High pressure homogenization; Alkaline pretreatment; Biogas production; Combined pretreatment,2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.5004/dwt.2017.0288,Chemical,alkaline,,activated sludge,sewage sludge,,,,,,,,,

Enhancement of biogas production from Ulva sp by using solid-state fermentation as biological pretreatment,"The green macroalgal biomass corresponds to an emerging and promising biofuel feedstock. Their biological pretreatment and energetic conversion to biomethane were investigated and the enhancement of biogas production using the solid-state fermentation (SSF) as an eco-friendly innovative pretreatment of Ulva sp. was precisely assessed. Compared to conventional acid and alkali pretreatments, the highest methane potential of 153 +/- 3 mL CH4 g(-1)VS with an anaerobic biodegradability of 57% was obtained using SSF pretreatment with a locally isolated Aspergillus fumigatus SL1 strain.

Effect of three pretreatment techniques on the chemical composition and on the methane yields of Opuntia ficus-indica (prickly pear) biomass,"Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) is an emerging biomass that has the potential to be used as substrate in anaerobic digestion. The goal of this work was to investigate the effect of three pretreatment techniques (thermal, alkaline, acidic) on the chemical composition and the methane yield of OFI biomass. A composite experimental design with three factors and two to three levels was implemented, and regression modelling was employed using a total of 10 biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests. The measured methane yields ranged from 289 to 604 NmL/gVS(added); according to the results, only the acidic pretreatment (HCl) was found to significantly increase methane generation. However, as the experimental values were quite high with regards to the theoretical methane yield of the substrate, this effect still needs to be confirmed via further research. The alkaline pretreatment (NaOH) did not noticeably affect methane yields (an average reduction of 8% was recorded), despite the fact that it did significantly reduce the lignin content. Thermal pretreatment had no effect on the methane yields or the chemical composition. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed changes in the chemical structure after the addition of NaOH and HCl. Modelling of the cumulated methane production by the Gompertz modified equation was successful and aided in understanding kinetic advantages linked to some of the pretreatments. For example, the alkaline treatment (at the 20% dosage) at room temperature resulted to a (max) (maximum specific methane production rate [NmLCH(4)/(gVS(added).d)]) equal to 36.3 against 18.6 for the control.","Calabro, PS; Catalan, E; Folino, A; Sanchez, A; Komilis, D",Anaerobic digestion; biogas; cactus biomass; cellulose; hemicellulose; lignin; Opuntia ficus-indica; pretreatment,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0734242X17741193,Physical,thermal,,lignocellulose,opuntia,plant,,,,,,,,

Optimisation of biogas production from the macroalgae Laminaria sp at different periods of harvesting in Ireland,"Brown seaweeds are a suitable substrate for biogas production through anaerobic digestion (AD). Since the carbohydrates' content is subjected to a seasonal variation, this research aimed to select the best harveking period of beach cast brown seaweed Laminaria sp. for methane production, while optimising the use of a beating pretreatment and the organic substrate concentration. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to estimate the effect of the beating pretreatment in terms of pretreatment time (5-10-15 min) and organic matter concentration in terms of volatile solids (VS) (1-2.5-4%) on methane production. The highest methane yield of 342 +/- 17 ml g(-1) VS was observed during November at 1% of VS and after 5 min of pretreatment, while the lowest yields were registered in March with an average of 163 28 ml g-1 VS. However, an enhancement of 47% with respect to the untreated sample was achieved at 2.5% of VS and after 15 min of pretreatment, in March. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Enhancement of anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge by electrochemical pretreatment,"Electrochemical pretreatment (EP) with a pair of Ti/RuO2 mesh plate electrodes was applied to solubilize waste activated sludge (WAS) with the aid of hypochlorite, and the conventional pretreatment methods of thermal pretreatment (THP), thermal-alkaline pretreatment (TAP) and alkaline pretreatment (AP) were also introduced as the comparative cases. In this study, Growth Rate of Solubilization (GRS) was developed to characterize the solubilization process of WAS in terms of SCOD (soluble chemical oxygen demand), carbohydrates, proteins, VFAs, and the highest GRS (SCOD) was found in EP-group, with approximately 5.2 times higher than that in AP group. Around 647 L/kgVS (volatile solids) of biogas was obtained in EP-group, which was up to 63.4% more than that in the control group (396 L/kgVS), and the corresponding VS removal efficiency reached to 45.5%. Therefore, EP might be a promising enhancement method for sludge solubilization, and thus contribute to the anaerobic digestion process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of ultrasonic pretreatment on the solubilization and kinetic study of biogas production from anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge,"Waste activated sludge (WAS) is a polluting waste with severe management problems that must be treated to prevent pollution and human health risks. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is the most used process to stabilize sludge; however, it must be improved because the biomethanation of sludge entails low biodegradability, pathogen inactivation, and biogas production. This study investigated the effects of ultrasonic pretreatment (USp) of WAS as a strategy to improve AD. Macromolecule solubilization, heavy metal behavior, pathogen inactivation and biogas production were evaluated. USp was applied at a range of 5000-35000 kJ/kg TS (total solids). The maximum solubilization degree of soluble chemical oxygen demand was 26%, and 22.9% of proteins at 35000 kJ/kg TS. The highest USp reduced only 2 log units of pathogens; nevertheless, a high inactivation was obtained when TS were reduced to 2% and continuous stirring was applied. AD of raw and sonicated WAS were compared with biochemical methane potential tests, and a biogas overproduction of 31.43% (219.5 mL/g VS) was achieved at highest USp. A modified Gompertz model was used for kinetic study of biogas production. The kinetic parameters at highest energy were: biogas production potential, G(0) = 634.2 mL; maximum biogas production rate, R-max = 57.23 mL/day. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Fungal pretreatment of unsterilized yard trimmings for enhanced methane production by solid-state anaerobic digestion,"Fungal pretreatment is an environmentally friendly process that has been widely studied to improve the digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass. However, sterilization of feedstocks, a costly process, is generally required prior to the fungal pretreatment. In this study, fungal pretreatment of unsterilized yard trimmings using yard trimmings pre-colonized with Ceriporiopsis subvermispora as an inoculum was investigated. Degradation of lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, and dry matter in yard trimmings during 30 days of fungal pretreatment using different inoculum/substrate ratios (1:19, 1:9 and 1:4) was 14.8-20.2%, 8.1-15.4%, 20.7-27.8%, and 9.8-16.2%, respectively. Methane yields of 34.9-44.6 L/kg volatile solids were achieved during solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD) of the pretreated yard trimmings, which were comparable to those obtained by using the traditional method requiring feedstock sterilization. The technology developed in this study can save about 501-789 kJ/kg of dry yard trimmings processed, which is about half of the total biogas energy produced by SS-AD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Pretreatment Chemometrics in Holistic Biogas Life Cycle Assessment: Framing Case Study with Carica papaya,"This research explores synergistic pre-treatment parameters and chemometrics as applicable to systems level biogas related research frameworks (such as the sustainable development goals) for anaerobic digestion biomass processes-policy. Specifically, the hypothesis that simple feedstock pretreatment-digestion methods can be applied to rapidly evaluate biochemical biogas potential of anaerobically digested Carica papaya petioles was tested. Pretreatment parameters explored include hydration, i.e. 1:4, 1:6, 1:8 and 1:10 substrate mass to water weight ratios and hydrochloric acid pretreatment chemistry, i.e. 1%-0.3 M, 3%-0.7 M, 5%-1.0 M, in batch digestions experiments with non-inoculated C. papaya petioles. Biomass feedstock was obtained from Edo State, Nigeria. Digestions were performed at ambient temperature, i.e. 27 degrees C, for 3 weeks. Pretreated C. papaya petiole samples were analyzed with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to characterize spectra with characteristic absorbance ratios indicative of physicochemical changes in biomass that include; cross-linked lignin ratio, the lateral order index, and hydrogen bond intensity. Cumulative gaseous yields from C. papaya petiole digestions were fit to the modified Gompertz form and optimized with non-linear regression in Matlab (R) to derive mathematical parameters, i.e. daily maximum production rate of biogas, a lag phase prior to biogas production, and biogas potential. An optimum C. papaya petiole pretreatment digestion scenario, i.e. 1:4 substrate-to-water ratio and 3%, i.e. 0.7 M, HCl pretreatment resulted in a 150% increase in yield, (10.9 mL gas/g VS) compared to non-pretreated C. papaya petiole digestion. Analysis with the modified Gompertz form also suggests rapid biogas potential assessment can be performed in a few days-time, i.e. approximately 10 days with distinct visual characterization of individual digestion performance. It was concluded that the applied digestion procedures with the use of C. papaya petioles can evolve gas rapidly. It was also concluded that obtained FTIR spectra are indicative of hydrolysis acid pretreatment chemistry, i.e. decrease in glycosidic beta-(1,4) bonds in cellulose compared to crystalline structure of cellulose, suggesting that spectroscopy chemometrics can inform systems frameworks.

Bioconversion of Dried Leaves from Algerian Date Palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) to Biogas by Anaerobic Digestion,"This work aimed to study anaerobic digestion of a new substrate made from the waste of Algerian date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) in order to evaluate its biogas production capacity. The lignocellulosic component biodegradability and the process stability were also tested. Two reactors were launched with the same concentration of 20g total solid (TS)/L. A physical pre-treatment (grinding) of dried leaves lowered the substrate size below 2 mm. The theoretical methane yield (499 - 538 mL CH4/g of Volatile Solids (VS)) indicated a high substrate methanogen potential. The tested methane and biogas yield reached 130 +/- 6 mL CH4/gVS and 197 +/- 6 mL/g VS respectively. The biodegradability through the volatiles solid reduction was 29%. The total alkalinity (TA) value increased from the beginning to the end, due to the substrate nature which gave a high buffering capacity of the medium. During the stable process, a higher Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal was reached with a value of 77.58%. The majority of the biogas yield was generated during the same period, which confirmed that the anaerobic digestion process stability is indispensable. Finally, this study was an opportunity to better exploit local by-products for the bioenergy production.","Djaafri, M; Kalloum, S; Soulimani, AE; Khelafi, M",anaerobic digestion; biogas; biodegradability; leaflets (Phoenix dactylifera L.); lignocellulosic compounds; mechanical pretreatment,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/JERA.41.131,Physical,mechanical desintegration,grinding,lignocellulose,phoenix dactylifera,leaves,,,,,,,,

Improving biomethane yield by strengthening acidification of maize stover in two-phase anaerobic digestion,"In this study, the acidification and two-phase anaerobic digestion (AD) were conducted in batch and continuous stirred tank reactors, respectively, to determine the effect of acidification on methane production in AD. The results showed that two-phase AD achieved an observable enhancement in the methane production under optimal acidification conditions (organic loading rate of 60 g TS/L, the ratio of raw material to inoculum (based on dry weight) of 2:1, the temperature of 45 degrees C, urea concentration of 4%, and time of 6 d). Under these conditions, the daily biogas and biomethane productions were 0.48 L/g TS and 0.30 L/g TS, respectively, which were 26.32% and 57.89% higher than those of the untreated group, respectively. The ammonia nitrogen (AN), alkalinity, and pH value of the methanogenic phase of C4 continued to increase up to 956 mg/L, 5680 mg/L, and 7.41, respectively, after 60 d, which might have destroyed the stability of the system. Therefore, for the purpose of reusing the nitrogen source, reducing AN, and maintaining the stability of the reaction system, another set of acidification and two-phase AD with water pretreatment using the discharge of the methanogenic phase of C4 as the inoculum was subsequently conducted. The results showed that the daily biogas productions of single-phase and two-phase AD were 5.26% and 15.79% higher than that of the untreated group, respectively; similarly, their daily methane yields were 10.42% and 21.05% higher than that of the untreated group.","Tong, H; Zhou, BY; Liu, CM; Wachemo, AC; Li, XJ; Zuo, XY",alkaline pretreatment; two-phase anaerobic digestion; strengthening acidification; maize stover; reactor; biogas; biomethane production,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.25165/j.ijabe.20201304.4654,Chemical,acidic,,lignocellulose,corn,stover,,,,,,,,
Enhancing methane production from lignocellulosic biomass by combined steam-explosion pretreatment and bioaugmentation with cellulolytic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor bescii,"Background: Biogas production from lignocellulosic biomass is generally considered to be challenging due to the recalcitrant nature of this biomass. In this study, the recalcitrance of birch was reduced by applying steam-explosion (SE) pretreatment (210 degrees C and 10 min). Moreover, bioaugmentation with the cellulolytic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor bescii was applied to possibly enhance the methane production from steam-exploded birch in an anaerobic digestion (AD) process under thermophilic conditions (62 degrees C). Results: Overall, the combined SE and bioaugmentation enhanced the methane yield up to 140% compared to untreated birch, while SE alone contributed to the major share of methane enhancement by 118%. The best methane improvement of 140% on day 50 was observed in bottles fed with pretreated birch and bioaugmentation with lower dosages of C. bescii (2 and 5% of inoculum volume). The maximum methane production rate also increased from 4-mL -CH4/g VS (volatile solids)/day for untreated birch to 9-14-mL-CH4/g VS/day for steam-exploded birch with applied bioaugmentation. Bioaugmentation was particularly effective for increasing the initial methane production rate of the pretreated birch yielding 21-44% more methane than the pretreated birch without applied bioaugmentation. The extent of solubilization of the organic matter was increased by more than twofold when combined SE pretreatment and bioaugmentation was used in comparison with the methane production from untreated birch.

Enhancing methane production from lignocellulosic biomass by combined steam-explosion pretreatment and bioaugmentation with cellulolytic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor bescii,"Background: Biogas production from lignocellulosic biomass is generally considered to be challenging due to the recalcitrant nature of this biomass. In this study, the recalcitrance of birch was reduced by applying steam-explosion (SE) pretreatment (210 degrees C and 10 min). Moreover, bioaugmentation with the cellulolytic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor bescii was applied to possibly enhance the methane production from steam-exploded birch in an anaerobic digestion (AD) process under thermophilic conditions (62 degrees C). Results: Overall, the combined SE and bioaugmentation enhanced the methane yield up to 140% compared to untreated birch, while SE alone contributed to the major share of methane enhancement by 118%. The best methane improvement of 140% on day 50 was observed in bottles fed with pretreated birch and bioaugmentation with lower dosages of C. bescii (2 and 5% of inoculum volume). The maximum methane production rate also increased from 4-mL -CH4/g VS (volatile solids)/day for untreated birch to 9-14-mL-CH4/g VS/day for steam-exploded birch with applied bioaugmentation. Bioaugmentation was particularly effective for increasing the initial methane production rate of the pretreated birch yielding 21-44% more methane than the pretreated birch without applied bioaugmentation. The extent of solubilization of the organic matter was increased by more than twofold when combined SE pretreatment and bioaugmentation was used in comparison with the methane production from untreated birch. The beneficial effects of SE and bioaugmentation on methane yield indicated that biomass recalcitrance and hydrolysis step are the limiting factors for efficient AD of lignocellulosic biomass. Microbial community analysis by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing showed that the microbial community composition was altered by the pretreatment and bioaugmentation processes. Notably, the enhanced methane production by pretreatment and bioaugmentation was well correlated with the increase in abundance of key bacterial and archaeal communities, particularly the hydrolytic bacterium Caldicoprobacter, several members of syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria and the hydrogenotrophic Methanothermobacter.

Influence of Thermal and Bacterial Pretreatment of Microalgae on Biogas Production in Mesophilic and Thermophilic Conditions,"Microalgae biomass has a great potential in search for new alternative energy sources. They can be used as a substrate for the biogas production in anaerobic digestion. When using microalgae, the efficiency of this process is hampered due to the resistant cell wall. In order to accelerate the hydrolysis of cell wall and increase the efficiency of biogas production we applied two different pretreatments - biological and thermal under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. During biological pretreatment we incubated microalgae with anaerobic hydrolytic bacteria Pseudobutyrivibrio xylanivorans Mz5(T). In thermal pretreatment we incubated microalgae at 90 degrees C. We also tested a combined thermal and biological pretreatment in which we incubated P. xylanivorans Mz5(T) with thermally pretreated microalgae.

Influence of Different Pretreatment Methods and Conditions on the Anaerobic Digestion Efficiency of Spent Mushroom Substrate,"Consumption of mushrooms has recently increased due to their health benefits; consequently, increased mushroom cultivation generates large volumes of spent mushroom substrate (SMS) and effective methods for SMS valorization are thus required. Anaerobic digestion (AD) processes SMS with minimal energy and reduces the amount of waste generated; moreover, it contributes to energy generation through biogas production. To improve the energy efficiency of AD and promote sufficient biomass pretreatment, thermal pretreatment conditions require further investigation. Here, we evaluated the pretreatment efficiency and biogas production of the SMS thermal pretreatment process, studying different pretreatment temperatures to understand the formation of SMS degradation products and the changes in AD efficiency. Particularly, mechanical and hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) methods were employed to improve SMS biodegradability. By increasing the substrate solubilization efficiency, HTP increased the biogas yield more effectively than mechanical pretreatment. Additionally, HTP improved the substrate's physicochemical properties and increased the reactive surface area for microorganisms by changing the substrate morphology. Further, the biodegradability of the hydrothermally pretreated SMS was higher (87.46%) than that of the mechanically pretreated SMS (61.37%).

Effect of ultrasonic pretreatment on the semicontinuous anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge with increasing loading rates,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) is the most widely used method to stabilize and recover energy from waste activated sludge (WAS). However, AD of sludge results in a low biogas yield.

Production of biogas and fermentable sugars from spent brewery grains: Evaluation of one- and two-stage thermal pretreatment in an integrated biorefinery,"In this study, the production of fermentable sugars and biogas from thermally pretreated brewer's spent grains (BSGs) was investigated.

The highest specific methane production (302.4 NLCH4 kg(COD)(-1)) and enzymatic hydrolysis yield (EHY of 98%, 50 FPU g(BSG)(-1)) were obtained from the two-stage pretreatment, with the second stage operated at 180 degrees C for 60 min, 5 mL(H2O)center dot g(BSG)(-1).

The burning of biogas produced from an anaerobic digestion of liquid fractions (hydrolysates) generated after two-stage thermal pretreatment in a combined heat and power system can produce a net thermal energy of 1.71 MJ kg(BSG) (-1)(dry basis) and electrical energy of 0.392 kW h kg(BSG) (-1)(dry basis).","de Camargos, AB; da Fonseca, YA; Silva, NCS; Barreto, ED; Adarme, OFH; Paranhos, AGD; Gurgel, LVA; Baeta, BEL",Brewer's spent grains; Thermal pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Enzymatic hydrolysis; Lignocellullosic biomass,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2021.105960,Physical,thermal,,lignocellulose,spent grains,spent grains,,,,,,,,
Improvement of empty palm fruit bunches biodegradability and biogas production by integrating the straw mushroom cultivation as a pretreatment in the solid-state anaerobic digestion,"Empty fruit bunches (EFB) have low biodegradability and restrict their commercial utilization in biogas plants. Integration of straw mushroom (Volvariella volvacea) cultivation as a function of bio-pretreatment on EFB to improve biodegradability and methane production by solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD) was investigated. The mushroom yield was 47.3 kg center dot tonne(-1) EFB with remaining weight in spent mushroom-EFB (S-mEFB) of 82%. The cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin of EFB were degraded by 3.3%, 21.3%, and 17.6%, respectively, with an increased surface area of S-mEFB. The biodegradability of S-mEFB (62.7%) was 2 times higher than raw EFB (33.5%) with the highest methane yield and production of 281 mL CH4 center dot g(-1) VS and 50.6 m(3)center dot tonne(-1) S-mEFB, respectively.

Performance of thermal pretreatment and mesophilic fermentation system on pathogen inactivation and biogas production of faecal sludge: Initial laboratory results,"The performance of thermal pretreatment of faecal sludge and biogas production of continuous stirred tank reaetor (TPCSTR) system on faecal sludge was evaluated in the laboratory of the University of Science and Technology Beijing, China. First, the effectiveness of thermal pretreatment on the inactivation of pathogens and the relationship between complete inactivation time and TS were researched. Second, the effect of sludge retention time (SRT) on the TPCSTR performance of faecal sludge was investigated. Results demonstrated that the time it took for the complete inactivation of pathogens (i.e., faecal coliform, salmonella spp., faecal streptococcus) was 60, 60, 80, 80, 100, 100, and 100 min for the TS faecal sludge concentrations of 1%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, 10%, and 12%, respectively. The experiments showed that the TPCSTR process was stable and efficient to inactivate pathogens under the operation conditions (i.e., TS = 8%, agitation speed = 120 rpm, and temperature = 37 +/- 1 degrees C).

Methane production from acid hydrolysates of Agave tequilana bagasse: Evaluation of hydrolysis conditions and methane yield,"Evaluation of diluted acid hydrolysis for sugar extraction from cooked and uncooked Agave tequilana bagasse and feasibility of using the hydrolysates as substrate for methane production, with and without nutrient addition, in anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (AnSBR) were studied. Results showed that the hydrolysis over the cooked bagasse was more effective for sugar extraction at the studied conditions. Total sugars concentration in the cooked and uncooked bagasse hydrolysates were 27.9 g/L and 18.7 g/L, respectively. However, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural was detected in the cooked bagasse hydrolysate, and therefore, the uncooked bagasse hydrolysate was selected as substrate for methane production. Interestingly, results showed that the AnSBR operated without nutrient addition obtained a constant methane production (0.26 L CH4/g COD), whereas the AnSBR operated with nutrient addition presented a gradual methane suppression. Molecular analyses suggested that methane suppression in the experiment with nutrient addition was due to a negative effect over the archaeal/bacterial ratio.

High pressure homogenization and two-phased anaerobic digestion for enhanced biogas conversion from municipal waste sludge,"This study compared advanced anaerobic digestion combining two-phased anaerobic digestion (2PAD) with high pressure homogenization (HPH) pretreatment to conventional anaerobic digestion of municipal sludge at laboratory scale.

Upon acclimation of anaerobic inocula to pretreatments, a total number of twelve lab-scale digesters were operated under scenarios including single-stage (control), 2PAD, and HPH coupled with 2PAD (HPH + 2PAD) at sludge retention times (SRTs) of 20, 14 and 7 days. Between mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures, mesophilic digestion was found to benefit more from pretreatments. Relative (to control) improvements in methane yield and volatile solids (VS) removals increased noticeably as SRT was shortened from 20 to 14 and 7 days. HPH + 2PAD system was found to achieve the maximum methane production (0.61-1.32 L CH4/L-digester-d) and VS removals (43-64%). Thermophilic control, 2PAD and HPH + 2PAD systems resulted in significant pathogen removals meeting Class A biosolids requirements according to Organic Matter Recycling Regulations (OMRR) of British Columbia (BC) at 20 d SRT. Energy analysis indicated that all the digestion scenarios attained positive energy balance with 2PAD system operated at 20 d SRT producing the maximum net energy of 4.76 GJ/tonne CODadded.

Advanced anaerobic digestion of municipal sludge using a novel and energy-efficient radio frequency pretreatment system,"Microwave (MW) sludge pretreatment systems are usually limited to a frequency of 2.45 GHz and the heating frequency is constrained by commercially available hardware. Studies using MW heating at this frequency have reported negative net energy balance (output energy as methane minus input electrical energy). This necessitates further research into more efficient thermal pretreatment technologies. In this research, a novel and highly efficient radio frequency (RF) pretreatment system at a frequency of 13.56 MHz was designed, implemented, and tested for the first time. The system was custom-designed based on the dielectric characteristics of thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS) to achieve a very efficient and uniform heating system. The effects of three factors including pretreatment method (RF vs. MW), final temperature (60, 90 and 120 degrees C), and stationary (holding) time (0, 1 and 2 h) on sludge solubilization and performance of mesophilic batch anaerobic digestion were evaluated simultaneously. Energy measurements were also made to compare the efficiency of the custom-designed RF and conventional MW heating systems. The differences in sludge disintegration (solubilization) using the RF and MW pretreatment systems were negligible (P > 0.05). No statistically significant difference was also observed between the two pretreatment systems in terms of mesophilic biogas production rate and extent (P > 0.05). The energy efficiency of the RF pretreatment system was measured between 67.3 and 95.5% for the temperature range of 25-120 degrees C which was significantly higher than that of the MW system efficiency which varied from 37 to 43%. Overall, the average input energy of the RF system was less than half of the energy consumed during the operation of the MW system to achieve a same target temperature. Considering the results of this research, the RF heating at a frequency of 13.56 MHz is suggested as an effective and energy-efficient technique for thermal hydrolysis of TWAS. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Biogas generation from floral waste using different techniques,"There is a great need to implement low-cost and user-friendly methods for further propagation of biogas technology in India. Environment unfriendly disposal of floral waste causes serious environmental pollution. Literature shows a limited research work regarding the anaerobic digestion of floral waste for biogas generation. The present experimental work aims to propagate floral waste as a sustainable source of biogas energy in India. Using different techniques like novel alkaline pretreatment, solar heating of the digester and co-digestion with food waste give enhanced biogas production from floral waste. A novel alkaline pretreatment of the floral waste using sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate gives an improvement in biogas output by 106%, with a saving in the cost of chemical pretreatment up to 96%, compared to traditional sodium hydroxide pretreatment. Also, solar heating of the digester increases the biogas output by 122% as compared to digesters in ambient conditions. Co-digestion of the floral waste with food waste also improves biogas output by 32.6%. Raw biogas from floral waste contains over 57% methane, which is higher than the previous studies. Large-scale application of the techniques can benefit the society. (C) 2019 GJESM.

Biogas Production from Distilled Grain Waste by Thermophilic Dry Anaerobic Digestion: Pretreatment of Feedstock and Dynamics of Microbial Community,"Distilled grain waste (DGW) eluted from the Chinese liquor making process poses potential serious environmental problems. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of converting DGW to biogas by thermophilic dry anaerobic digestion. To improve biogas production, the effects of dilute H2SO4 and thermal pretreatment on DGW were evaluated by biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests. The results indicate that 90 A degrees C thermal pretreatment provided the highest methane production at 212.7 mL/g-VTSadd. The long-term thermophilic dry anaerobic digestion process was conducted in a 5-L separable flask for more than 3 years at a volatile total solid (VTS) loading rate of 1 g/kg-sludge/d, using synthetic waste, untreated and 90 A degrees C thermal pretreated DGW as the feedstock, respectively. A higher methane production, 451.6 mL/g-VTSadd, was obtained when synthetic waste was used; the methane production decreased to 139.4 mL/g-VTSadd when the untreated DGW was used. The 90 A degrees C thermal pretreated DGW increased the methane production to 190.5 mL/g-VTSadd, showing an increase of 36.7% in methane production compared with that using untreated DGW. The microbial community structure analysis indicates that the microbial community in the thermophilic dry anaerobic digestion system maintained a similar structure when untreated or pretreated DGW was used, whereas the structure differed significantly when synthetic waste was used as the feedstock.","Wang, TT; Sun, ZY; Huang, YL; Tan, L; Tang, YQ; Kida, K",Distilled grain waste; Thermophilic dry anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Biochemical methane potentialS; Thermal pretreatment; Microbial community,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-017-2557-6,Physical,thermal,,lignocellulose,spent grains,spent grains,,,,,,,,

High-Solids Anaerobic Digestion of Municipal Sludge Pretreated by Thermal Hydrolysis,"High-solids anaerobic digestion can consistently achieve 55 to 60% volatile solids destruction after thermal hydrolysis pretreatment, which reduces its viscosity and increases the fraction of soluble organic matter. For feed sludge with total solids concentrations between 6.8 and 8.2%, the process is stable at hydraulic retention times of 9 to 12 days, significantly increasing the treatment capacity of existing digesters or, in treatment plants without spare capacity, helping to postpone, reduce, or even avoid costly infrastructure investments. Process stability is related to the high concentration of soluble organic matter in the digesters. High-solids temperature-phased digestion appears to be superior to high-solids mesophilic digestion, with respect to process flexibility and stability, biosolids stabilization, and biogas generation, although ammonia inhibition may have occurred. Implementation of high-solids digestion could significantly reduce operation and maintenance costs of solids-handling operations. Water Environ.

Optimized alkaline pretreatment of sludge before anaerobic digestion,"NaOH was used to disintegrate a mixture composed mainly of primary sludge with biofilm sludge before anaerobic digestion in batch experiments. NaOH pretreatment dissolved some organic substances, and the optimum dose was 0.1 mol/L. After the alkali-treated sludge was fed into the digesters, the higher pH delayed the start of digestion and reduced the biogas production during the initial stage, although the system recovered after a lag phase when the dose was lower than 0.04 mol/L. Acid conditioning was necessary, but the increased salinity also impacted on the digestion efficiency. For sludge pretreatment, the optimum NaOH dose was 0.1 mol/L, and the initial pH of the batch digesters needs to be controlled at less than eight. Under optimized conditions, the organic degradation rate was 38.3% and the biogas yield was 0.65 L/g volatile suspended solid (VSS), whereas these values for the control were 30.3% and 0.64 L/g VSS, respectively.

The results obtained in this study indicate than the best pretreatment is precomposting. since an increase of the microorganism's maximum specific growth rate (mu(max)) between 160 and 205%, with respect to non-pretreated OFMSW. can be achieved.

Enhancing the biogas production and the treated effluent quality via an alternative Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) treatment process: Integration of thermal pretreatment and dewatering,"To address the limitations associated with the disposal management and the treatment process of POME, an alternative process that consists of eliminating the cooling ponds and integrating a pretreatment technology combined with a dewatering device was proposed. Since the proposed treatment process has not been tested previously, the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of thermal pretreatment and solid loading alteration via dewatering on a thermophilic continuous set up consisting of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket - hollow centered packed bed (UASB-HCPB) bioreactor. It was established that the best performing solid loading was the 40S:60L, which is made up of 40% by volume of POME settled solids and 60% of clarified liquid. Thermally pretreated 40S:60L solid loading had a significantly enhanced biogas production, methane purity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), and total suspended solids (TSS) removal efficiencies. The reactor exhibited stability owing to the low volatile fatty acid/alkalinity ratio obtained throughout the run. With a reactor capacity of 5L, thermally pretreated 40S:60L achieved a daily biogas production volume of 48L and a methane purity of 77.2%. The COD, BOD, and TSS removal efficiencies of the thermally pretreated 40S:60L solid loading were evaluated to be 97.5, 95.1, and 94.5%. The enhanced process performance is due to the consistent solids concentration, which allowed a more effective mass transfer and transport in the medium. Meanwhile, thermal pretreatment promoted cell lysis, making the intercellular organic matter readily available for the bacteria consortium.","Khadaroo, SNBA; Grassia, P; Gouwanda, D; He, J; Poh, PE",Thermal&nbsp; pretreatment; Dewatering; Thermophilic anaerobic digestion; High-rate bioreactor; Biogas&nbsp; production; Microbial community analysis,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2021.106167,Physical,thermal,,food industry organic waste,palm oil mill effluent,,,,,,,,,
Evaluation of operational parameters for biodegration of bacterially disintegrated sludge,"The present investigation was undertaken to increase the efficiency of sludge solubilization using bacterial pretreatment with a thermophilic protease secreting bacteria, Bacillus licheniformis and deflocculation through ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA). About 0.4% of EDTA was used to remove the flocs from the sludge. Then, the deflocculated and bacterially pretreated sludge was subsequently followed by aerobic and anaerobic digestion. In comparison with the control, the aerobic digestion showed 43% increase in the reduction of suspended solids (SS) and 13% increase in the solubilization of chemical oxygen demand. Pretreatment of deflocculated sludge along with anaerobic digestion prompt to 34% of SS and 38% of volatile solids reduction, with an enhancement of 65% biogas production. Pretreatment of deflocculated sludge with B. licheniformis elevates less energy, which was environmentally sound when compared to other pretreatment techniques.","Banu, JR; Ushani, U; Merrylin, J; Kaliappan, S",EPS removal; Bacterial pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Biochemical methane potential test; Anaerobic digestion; Suspended solids,2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19443994.2016.1150888,Biological,bacterial,Bacillus licheniformis,activated sludge,sludge,,,,,,,,,
Enhanced Biogas Production During Anaerobic Digestion of Steam-Pretreated Lignocellulosic Biomass from Williams Cavendish Banana Plants,"In the context of green energy valorisation, this study reports the chemical analysis and improvement of biogas production via anaerobic digestion of treated and untreated agricultural waste lignocellulosic biomass from Williams Cavendish banana plants (WCLB). With a worldwide annual production of 26 million tons of dry matter (DM), large amounts of this waste are abandoned in plantations after fruit harvesting. Steam explosion (SE) and steam cracking (SC) pretreatments were investigated at severity factors of 3.16 and 4.29, respectively, to improve the biogas potential over 135 days under mesophilic conditions. The study revealed a carbon (C)/nitrogen (N) ratio of 27.3, indicating that WCLB has sufficient N content for successful fermentation. The proportions of liquid and solid fractions recovered after SC were 20 and 80%, respectively, whereas SE yielded 17 and 83% liquid and solids, respectively. The neutral sugar content of the studied fractions indicated that glucose and xylose constituted the highest hexose and pentose fractions, respectively, in WCLB. The highest and lowest total biogas potentials were obtained from LFSC (280 mL g(-1) of DM) and untreated WCLB (240 mL g(-1) of DM), respectively. The methane yield from untreated WCLB and combined solid and liquid fractions from SE and SC were 40, 42, and 51%, respectively, of the theoretical methane potential. The maximum biogas production rate (7.8 mL g(-1) day(-1)) was obtained with SFSC. This study reveals that SC deconstructs WCLB efficiently and thereby greatly enhances methane production.","Kamdem, I; Hiligsmann, S; Vanderghem, C; Jacquet, N; Tiappi, FM; Richel, A; Jacques, P; Thonart, P",Anaerobic digestion; Lignocellulosic agricultural waste biomass; Biogas production; Diluted acid hydrolysis; Steam pretreatment; William Cavendish banana plants,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-016-9788-6,Physical,thermal,"steam explosion,steam cracking",lignocellulose,banana,stem,,,,,,,,
Electrohydrolysis pretreatment methods to enhance the methane production from anaerobic digestion of rice straw using graphite electrode,"This novel study is focused on estimating the electrohydrolysis pretreatment conditions using DC current (voltage and time) for enhancing the biodegradability of rice straw. The electrohydrolysis pretreatment was performed using graphite electrode with intermittent mode of input voltage fluctuating from 10 to 30 V (voltage study) and in continuous mode for 15-80 min (time study). The result implicated that electrohydrolysis pretreatment with 25 V and 60 min time achieved the maximum solublization (55%). The Batch tests (1 L) were performed to explore the accelerated biomethane production from enhanced solublization and to optimize the food microorganisms ratio. The different FPM (0.5-3) ratios showed the cumulative methane production ranging from 236 to 319 mL/g-VSadded (control -224.01 mL/g-VSadded). Compositional characterization (FESEM, XRD and FTIR) studies showed the efficacy in disrupting the lignin layer and reducing the cellulose crystallinity of rice straw. The effect of pretreatment on methane production was also kinetically analysed by modified Gompertz, logistic and transference function models. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Enhanced anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge of low organic content in a novel digester,"A novel digester, termed an internal circulation anaerobic digester (ICAD), was developed to intensify sludge digestion. It consists of reaction zone, settling zone, thickening zone, riser and downcomer. Internal circulation in the digester is intensified by backflow biogas. The mesophilic ICAD treating thermal pretreated waste activated sludge with volatile suspended solids (VSS)/suspended solids (SS) of 0.45-0.49 was conducted in this study to reduce and stabilize the low organic content sludge. The results showed that the VSS removal rate and biogas rate reached 46.0% and 0.72 m(3)/kg VSSfed at hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 15 days. VSS/SS and soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) of the effluent sludge ranged from 0.39 to 0.41 and 274 mg/L to 473 mg/L, respectively, under various HRTs from 10 to 27 days. The degradation ability of ICAD derived from the improved mass transfer by internal circulation and long solid retention time at short HRT is compared with continuous stirred tank reactor.","Wu, J; Jiang, Y; Cao, ZP; Li, ZH; Hu, YY; Li, HZ; Zuo, JE; Wang, KJ",enhanced anaerobic digestion; internal circulation anaerobic digester; mesophilic anaerobic digestion; thermal pretreatment; waste activated sludge,2015,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2015.296,Physical,thermal,,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
"Thermal, ultrasonic and electrochemical pretreatment methods to enhance the solubilization of organic substance and methane generation in food waste","Food waste accounts for the largest fraction of municipal solid waste, and one-third of the food produced goes to waste.

Use of microwave pretreatment for enhanced anaerobiosis of secondary sludge,"This work elucidates the effects of pretreatment of secondary sludge by microwave irradiation on anaerobic digestion. The soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration increased up to 22% as microwave irradiation time increased, which indicated the sludge particles disintegrated. Three identical automated bioreactors with working volume of 5 1 were used as anaerobic digesters at mesophilic temperature (35degreesC). The reactors were separately fed with sludge with microwave pretreated- and control-sludge at different hydraulic retention times (HRT). The volatile solid (VS) reduction in the control operation was approximately 23.2 +/-1.3%, while it was 25.7 +/- 0.8% for the reactors with the pretreated sludge. The average biogas production rate with the pretreated sludge at 8, 10, 12, and 15 days HRTs was 240 11, 183 +/- 9, 147 +/- 8, and 117 +/- 7 ml/l/d respectively, while those with the control sludge were 134 +/- 12 and 94 +/- 7 ml/l/d at 10 and 15 days HRTs. Maximum rates of COD removal and methane production with the pretreated sludge were 64% and 79% higher than those of the control system, respectively.","Park, B; Ahn, JH; Kim, J; Hwang, S",anaerobic digestion; microwave pretreatment; sludge disintegration,2004,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2004.0523,Physical,thermal,microwave,activated sludge,secondary sludge,,,,,,,,,
Enhanced biogas production of red microalgae via enzymatic pretreatment and preliminary economic assessment,"Microalgal biomass is a promising candidate for biogas production, however; cell characteristics may prevent accessibility of anaerobic microorganisms to organic matter and limits methane production from microalgae. Pretreatments provide enhancement in methane yields via cell wall disruption and cell membrane solubilization. In this study, improvement of methane production from Porphyridium cruentum by enzymatic pretreatment was investigated. Enzymatic pretreatment at 55 degrees C showed the highest solubilization efficiencies. Protease, viscozyme, and enzyme mix pretreatment showed highest solubilization increases as 32.3%, 30.4%, and 30.5%, respectively. Highest methane improvements from P. cruentum were achieved after protease pretreatment with the highest dose (0.5 mL/g dry biomass) at both mesophilic (77% improvement) and thermophilic conditions (100% improvement). Modified Gompertz model results showed that lag phase was reduced and methane production rates were improved after enzymatic pretreatment. Preliminary economic assessment results showed that the cost of enzymes makes enzymatic pretreatment is not economically feasible due to critical cost of enzyme yet. However, production of low cost enzymes could facilitate the use of enzymes in pretreatment of microalgae and biogas production.","Cakmak, EK; Ugurlu, A",Pretreatment; Enzymatic; Microalgae; Methane; Anaerobic digestion,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2020.101979,Biological,enzyme,,micro-algae,Porphyridium,Cruentum,5,3,,,9,,,
Enhancing solubilisation and methane production kinetic of switchgrass by microwave pretreatment,"This study investigated the effects of microwave pretreatment of switchgrass in order to enhance its anaerobic digestibility. Response surface analysis was applied to screen the effects of temperature and time of microwave pretreatment on matter solubilisation. The composite design showed that only temperature had a significant effect on solubilisation level. Then the effects of the microwave pretreatment were correlated to the pretreatment temperature. The sCOD/tCOD ratio was equal to 9.4% at 90 degrees C and increased until 13.8% at 180 degrees C. The BMP assays of 42 days showed that microwave pretreatment induced no change on the ultimate volume of methane but had an interesting effect on the reaction kinetic. Indeed, the time required to reach 80% of ultimate volume CH4 is reduced by 4.5 days at 150 degrees C using the microwave pretreatment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Exploring the Biomethane Potential of Different Industrial Hemp (Cannabis sativaL.)

In this study, different hemp biomass residues (HBRs) were evaluated as a potential feedstock for renewable biomethane production through anaerobic digestion (AD). The biochemical methane potential (BMP) of the raw and pretreated fibers, stalks, hurds, leaves and inflorescences was investigated by means of batch anaerobic tests. The highest BMP was obtained with the raw fibers (i.e., 422 +/- 20 mL CH4 center dot g VS-1), while hemp hurds (unretted), making up more than half of the whole hemp plant dry weight, showed a lower BMP value of 239 +/- 10 mL CH4 center dot g VS-1. The alkali pretreatment of unretted hurds and mechanical grinding of retted hurds effectively enhanced the BMP of both substrates by 15.9%.

Effect of organic loading rate on anaerobic digestion of thermally pretreated Scenedesmus sp biomass,"Biogas production is one of the means to produce a biofuel from microalgae. Biomass consisting mainly of Scenedesmus sp. was thermally pretreated and optimum pretreatment length (1 h) and temperature (90 degrees C) was selected. Different chemical composition among batches stored at 4 C for different lengths of time resulted in organic matter hydrolysis percentages ranging from 3% to 7%. The lower percentages were attributed to cell wall thickening observed during storage for 45 days. The different hydrolysis percentages did not cause differences in anaerobic digestion.

Regardless the OLR, inhibition caused by organic overloading or ammonia toxicity were not detected. Despite enhanced methane production, anaerobic biodegradability of this biomass remained low (32%).

Comparison of Mechanical Pretreatment Methods for the Enhancement of Anaerobic Digestion of Pulp and Paper Waste Activated Sludge,"The conventional anaerobic digestion process, requiring long solids retention times (SRTs) to digest solids, is currently viewed as impractical for the pulp and paper industry because of high capital costs associated with the construction of new digesters. Recent developments in sludge solubilization technology could be promising in reducing digester size, which also allows for the potential use of decommissioned tanks, both of which can reduce the capital cost. Three pretreatment technologies for use with anaerobic digestion were tested on laboratory-scale to investigate their feasibility. The SRTs in all three digesters systematically decreased from 20 to 3 days. The reference digester was fed waste activated sludge (WAS) to serve as the control at the same SRTs. The other digesters were fed WAS that had been preconditioned using mechanical shearing, sonication, or high-pressure homogenization technology. Anaerobic digestion with high-pressure homogenization produced as much methane at 3-day mean SRT as that from the reference digester operated at 20-day SRT. Therefore, a new digester can theoretically be 85% smaller than a conventional digester. An added benefit of WAS to methane conversion is the recovery of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus.

Stimulating methane production from microalgae by alkaline pretreatment and co-digestion with sludge,"Methane production through anaerobic digestion (AD) is a solution of energy recovery from microalgae, but some features of microalgae limit the efficiency of AD. In this study, alkaline pretreatment and co-digestion with sludge were both applied to enhance the methane production from microalgae in batch experiments. The results showed that alkaline pretreatment increased the disintegration degree of microalgae from 20% to 34% at maximum after 12-h treatment, but the specific methane production (SMP) only increased from 279 to 298 ml/g volatile solids (VS). Co-digestion with sludge stimulated methane production, and the best synergy with an SMP of 343 ml/g VS occurred when the ratio of microalgae to sludge reached 2:1 based on their VS. The yield was 12.4% and 20.0% higher than those from mono digestion of microalgae and sludge, respectively, and the synergy was evaluated at 14.8%. Therefore, co-digestion is a better choice for improving methane production from microalgae.","Du, XR; Tao, Y; Liu, YL; Li, H",Anaerobic digestion; methane; microalgae; pretreatment; sludge,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2018.1540665,Chemical,alkaline,,micro-algae,Spirulina ,,,,,,,,,
Energy Crops and Methane: Process Optimization of Ca(OH)(2) Assisted Thermal Pretreatment and Modeling of Methane Production,"Switchgrass earned its place globally as a significant energy crop by possessing essential properties such as being able to control erosion, low cost of production, biomass richness, and appeal for biofuel production. In this study, the impact of a Ca(OH)(2)-assisted thermal pretreatment process on the switchgrass variety Shawnee for methane fuel production was investigated. The Ca(OH)(2)-assisted thermal pretreatment process was optimized to enhance the methane production potential of switchgrass. Solid loading (3-7%), Ca(OH)(2) concentration (0-2%), reaction temperature (50-100 degrees C), and reaction time (6-16 h) were selected as independent variables for the optimization. Methane production was obtained as 248.7 mL CH4 gVS(-1) under the optimized pretreatment conditions. Specifically, a reaction temperature of 100 degrees C, a reaction time of 6 h, 0% Ca(OH)(2), and 3% solid loading. Compared to raw switchgrass, methane production was enhanced by 14.5%.

"Impact of milling, enzyme addition, and steam explosion on the solid waste biomethanation of an olive oil production plant","Anaerobic digestion is a consolidated bioprocess which can be further enhanced by incorporating an upstream pretreatment unit.

Microwave and its combined processes: an effective way for enhancing anaerobic digestion and dewaterability of sewage sludge?,"The enhancement for sludge anaerobic digestion and dewaterability were investigated in sludge pretreated by microwave (MW) and its combined processes. The results showed that microwave and its combined processes can efficiently release soluble organic matter and thus enhance anaerobic digestion of sludge. The cumulative methane production in the test of the MW-H2O2-OH (0.2) process was increased by 13.34% compared with that of the control. The MW-H process was effective in improving sludge dewaterability, e.g., the capillary suction time (CST) at only 9.85S.","Liu, JB; Tong, J; Wei, YS; Wang, YW",anaerobic digestion; dewaterability; microwave; sludge pretreatment,2015,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wrd.2015.120,Physical,thermal,microwave,activated sludge,sewage sludge,,,,,,,,,
Biomethane production and physicochemical characterization of anaerobically digested teff (Eragrostis tef) straw pretreated by sodium hydroxide,"The biogas production potential and biomethane content of teff straw through pretreatment by NaOH was investigated. Different NaOH concentrations (1%, 2%, 4% and 6%) were used for each four solid loadings (50, 65, 80 and 95 g/L). The effects of NaOH as pretreatment factor on the biodegradability of teff straw, changes in main compositions and enhancement of anaerobic digestion were analyzed. The result showed that, using 4% NaOH for pretreatment in 80 g/L solid loading produced 40.0% higher total biogas production and 48.1% higher biomethane content than the untreated sample of teff straw. Investigation of changes in chemical compositions and physical microstructure indicated that there was 4.3-22.1% total lignocellulosic compositions removal after three days pretreatment with NaOH. The results further revealed that NaOH pretreatment changed the structural compositions and lignin network, and improved biogas production from teff straw. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Microwave pretreatment of lignocellulosic agroindustrial waste for methane production,"This study focuses on the use of microwave heating as a pretreatment for lignocellulosic agroindustrial waste prior to anaerobic digestion for methane production. Four materials were investigated, namely winery waste, cotton gin waste, olive pomace and juice industry waste. Results showed different effects of microwave heating on the solubilization and methane potential of the studied substrates. The variations were attributed to the specific characteristics of each substrate combined with the pretreatment conditions. In the cases of winery waste and juice industry waste, microwave pretreatment resulted in relatively high solubilization levels for both materials. Nevertheless, the portion retained on the solid fraction after pretreatment was larger and less biodegradable for winery waste, while for juice industry waste it was smaller but with a higher biodegradability degree. As far as cotton gin waste and olive pomace are concerned, microwave pretreatment seems not to cause high organic matter solubilization, while it most likely induced structural changes in the materials matrices. This resulted in methane production levels that indicate the presence of recalcitrant or/and inhibitory compounds on the pretreated samples. Moreover, the increased moisture and hydrogen contents for pretreated samples suggested that additional changes were made to the substrates. Ultimately, although microwave pretreatment did not improve methane production, results indicated that at temperatures between 125 and 150 degrees C, such a process could eventually provide samples which are more suitable for methane production. Moreover, an improved energy balance could be obtained by combining these temperatures with lower exposure times and higher solid to liquid ratios. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Enhancement of waste activated sludge anaerobic digestion by a novel chemical free acid/alkaline pretreatment using electrolysis,"Anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge (WAS) is relatively poor due to hydrolysis limitations. Acid and alkaline pretreatments are effective in enhancing hydrolysis leading to higher methane yields. However, chemical costs often prohibit full-scale application. In this study, 12 V two-chamber electrolysis using an anion exchange membrane alters sludge pH without chemical dosing. pH dropped from 6.9 to 2.5 in the anode chamber and increased to 10.1 in the cathode chamber within 15 h. The volatile suspended solids solubilisation of WAS was 31.1% in the anode chamber and 34.0% in the cathode chamber. As a result, dissolved chemical oxygen demand increased from 164 to 1,787 mg/L and 1,256 mg/L in the anode and cathode chambers, respectively. Remixing of sludge from the two chambers brought the pH back to 6.5, hence no chemical neutralisation was required prior to anaerobic digestion. Methane yield during anaerobic digestion at 20 d retention time was 31% higher than that of untreated sludge. An energy balance assessment indicated that the non-optimised process could approximately recover the energy (electricity) expended in the electrolysis process. With suitable optimisation of treatment time and voltages, significant energy savings would be expected in addition to the benefit of decreased sludge volume.","Charles, W; Ng, B; Cord-Ruwisch, R; Cheng, L; Ho, G; Kayaalp, A",anaerobic digestion; electrolysis; pretreatment; waste activated sludge,2013,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2013.208,Physical,electrolysis,electrohydrolysis,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Effect of thermal hydrolysis and ultrasounds pretreatments on foaming in anaerobic digesters,"Foam appears regularly in anaerobic digesters producing operational and safety problems. In this research, based on the operational observation at semi-industrial pilot scale where sludge pretreatment mitigated foaming in anaerobic digesters, this study aimed at evaluating any potential relationship between foaming tools applied to activated sludge at lab-scale (foam potential, foam stability and Microthrix parvicella abundance) and the experimental behavior observed in pilot scale and full-scale anaerobic digesters. The potential of thermal hydrolysis and ultrasounds for reducing foaming capacity was also evaluated. Filamentous bacteria abundance was directly linked to foaming capacity in anaerobic processes. A maximum reduction of M. parvicella abundance (from 5 to 2) was reached using thermal hydrolysis with steam explosion at 170 degrees C and ultrasounds at 66.7 kWh/m(3), showing both good anti-foaming properties. On the other hand, foam potential and stability determinations showed a lack of consistency with the bacteria abundance results and experimental evidences. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this research, based on the operational observation at semi-industrial pilot scale where sludge pretreatment mitigated foaming in anaerobic digesters, this study aimed at evaluating any potential relationship between foaming tools applied to activated sludge at lab-scale (foam potential, foam stability and Microthrix parvicella abundance) and the experimental behavior observed in pilot scale and full-scale anaerobic digesters. The potential of thermal hydrolysis and ultrasounds for reducing foaming capacity was also evaluated. Filamentous bacteria abundance was directly linked to foaming capacity in anaerobic processes. A maximum reduction of M. parvicella abundance (from 5 to 2) was reached using thermal hydrolysis with steam explosion at 170 degrees C and ultrasounds at 66.7 kWh/m(3), showing both good anti-foaming properties. On the other hand, foam potential and stability determinations showed a lack of consistency with the bacteria abundance results and experimental evidences. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A Comparative Study of Ultrasonic Pretreatment and an Internal Recycle for the Enhancement of Mesophilic Anaerobic Digestion,"The objective of this study was to investigate the use of ultrasonic energy in an internal recycle and pretreatment mode of operation relative to a conventional mode of mesophilic anaerobic digestion. The primary focus was to determine if using ultrasonics in a pretreatment mode and in an internal recycle line produced changes in performance relative to each other and the control. Using a relatively low-energy sonication system, the data showed that the addition of ultrasonic energy, in either a recycle line or as a pretreatment technology, improved anaerobic digestion efficiency for waste-activated sludge. There was a 13 to 21% increase in biogas yield and an increase in total and volatile solids destruction of 3 to 10.3 additional percentage points, depending on the ultrasonic dose and location. Dewatering of the biosolids following ultrasonic treatment was poorer, as measured by an increase in the optimum polymer conditioning dose. The addition of ultrasonics to the digestion systems generated a more stable biosolids product, with a 2 to 58% reduction in organo-sulfur gas production from dewatered biosolids cakes.

"Initial examination of microwave pretreatment on primary, secondary and mixed sludges before and after anaerobic digestion","The effects of microwave pretreatment on disintegration and mesophilic digestion of waste activated sludge ( WAS), primary sludge ( PS), combined ( PS + WAS) sequencing batch reactor ( SBR) sludge and anaerobically digested biocake were investigated by both household and bench scale industrial types microwaves at temperatures below and above boiling point. Pretreatment variables, temperature, intensity ( cooking rate) and sludge concentration had statistically significant effects on solubilization. The microwave pretreatment also increased the bioavailability of sludge components under batch anaerobic digestion and enhanced the dewaterability of pretreated sludges after digestion. However, the level of improvements in solubilization and biodegradation from different waste sludges were different. While the largest improvement in ultimate biodegradation was observed in WAS, microwave irradiation only affected the rate of biodegradation of pretreated PS samples. Similarly, relatively lower solubilization ratios achieved for combined - SBR sludge was attributed to high sludge age of extended aeration SBR unit. It is possible that initial sludge characteristics may influence final pretreatment outcomes so that general statements of performance cannot always be made.","Eskicioglu, C; Kennedy, KJ; Droste, RL",anaerobic digestion; biocake; microwave pretreatment; PS; WAS,2008,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2008.010,Physical,thermal,microwave,activated sludge,sludge,,,,,,,,,
Effect of alkaline pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of olive mill solid waste,"The present study evaluates the influence of alkaline (NaOH) pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of olive pomace. Batch hydrolysis experiments with different NaOH dosages, process durations and temperatures were conducted, in which the variation of olive pomace solubilization in the liquid phase was investigated. The effect of pretreatment on anaerobic digestion was studied through biochemical methane potential assays. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the NaOH pretreatment in improving olive pomace solubilization as well as its biodegradability. Maximum specific methane yields were achieved at different NaOH dosages depending on the pretreatment temperature. Consequently, it was concluded that the two operating parameters of the pretreatment stage (NaOH dosage and temperature) may exert a joint effect on substrate biodegradability and methane yields. The highest methane yield (242 NmL CH4/gVS) was obtained for the material pretreated at 90 degrees C, at a dosage of 1 mmol/gVS (4% of VS). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Pre-treatment and inoculum affect the microbial community structure and enhance the biogas reactor performance in a pilot-scale biodigestion of municipal solid waste,"During anaerobic digestion of municipal solid waste, organic matter is converted to methane, carbon dioxide, and other organic and inorganic compounds through a complex cooperation among different microbial groups with different metabolic activities. Here, culture-dependent and independent approaches provided evidence for examining the relationship between bacterial and archaeal communities and methane production in a pilot-scale anaerobic digestion. The abundance of aerobic and anaerobic functional groups of C and N cycles, such as cellulolytic, pectinolytic, amylolytic and proteolytic bacteria, was high at the beginning of the experiment and was drastically decreased after anaerobic digestion. In contrast, the ammonifiers increased in the biogas producing reactors in a higher pH environment. The methanogenic archaeal genera recovered were Methanobrevibacter, Methanobacterium, Methanoculleus and Methanocorpusculum, thus indicating that methane was formed primarily by the hydrogenotrophic pathway in the reactors. Moreover, the mechanical pretreatment effects, as well as the effect of pelleted manure as inoculum, were considered. The highest methane production was detected in the biodigesters with minced organic waste, thus indicating that pre-treatment of a heterogeneous starting matrix was essential for improving biogas production and stabilizing the process.

Prerequisite - An electrohydrolysis pretreatment for anaerobic digestion of lignocellulose waste material,"This novel work is focused on evaluating the electrohydrolysis pretreatment conditions (applied voltage and time) and anaerobic digestion process for the biological bioconversion of pulp and paper mill sludge into biogas in batch assay. The pretreatment at 15 V for 45 min shows highest impact on sludge solubilization. The XRD and FT-IR spectroscopic characterization shows the development of aliphatic, unsaturated and carbonyl carbon functionalities in the pretreated samples. FESEM picture also qualities the change in alteration of structure after pretreatment. Batch anaerobic bioreactor was carried out to determine the efficacy of electrohydrolysis pretreated and untreated pulp and paper mill sludge.

New parameters to determine the optimum pretreatment for improving the biomethanization performance,"Thermochemical and biological pretreatments have been applied to the organic fraction of the municipal solid wastes (OFMSW) coming from an industrial 30 mm-trommel placed in a full-scale mechanical-biological treatment (MBT) plant in order to study their effects on the organic matter solubilization yield and the biomethanization process. To compare the effect of theses pre-treatments on anaerobic biodegradability of pretreated OFMSW, a series of batch experiments were carried out. The accumulated methane production and the temporary evolutions of the volatile fatty acids (VFA) have been used to define two new parameters (t(MAX) and t(OPT)) in order to compare the effect of the pre-treatments on anaerobic digestion of pretreated OFMSW. From the point of view of the biomethanization, the results indicate that the optimum pretreatment is the Precomposting, since it presents the lower t(OPT) ( 12 days) and in only 15 days of operation (t(MAX) = 15) the reactor achieves the maximum accumulated methane production, 37.51 vs. 7 I of the control digester for the same operation time.

Chemical pretreatment of lignocellulosic agroindustrial waste for methane production,"This study investigates the effect of different chemical pretreatments on the solubilization and the degradability of different solid agroindustrial waste, namely winery waste, cotton gin waste, olive pomace and juice industry waste. Eight different reagents were investigated, i.e. sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), sodium chloride (NaCl), citric acid (H(3)Cit), acetic acid (AcOH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), acetone (Me2CO) and ethanol (EtOH), under three condition sets resulting in treatments of varying intensity, depending on process duration, reagent dosage and temperature. Results indicated that chemical pretreatment under more severe conditions is more effective on the solubilization of lignocellulosic substrates, such as those of the present study and among the investigated reagents, H(3)Cit, H2O2 and EtOH appeared to be the most effective to this regard. At the same time, although chemical pretreatment in general did not improve the methane potential of the substrates, moderate to high severity conditions were found to generally be the most satisfactory in terms of methane production from pretreated materials. In fact, moderate severity treatments using EtOH for winery waste, H(3)Cit for olive pomace and H2O2 for juice industry waste and a high severity treatment with EtOH for cotton gin waste, resulted in maximum specific methane yield values. Ultimately, the impact of pretreatment parameters on the different substrates seems to be dependent on their characteristics, in combination with the specific mode of action of each reagent. The overall energy balance of such a system could probably be improved by using lower operating powers and higher solid to liquid ratios. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Chemical pretreatment of lignocellulosic agroindustrial waste for methane production,"This study investigates the effect of different chemical pretreatments on the solubilization and the degradability of different solid agroindustrial waste, namely winery waste, cotton gin waste, olive pomace and juice industry waste. Eight different reagents were investigated, i.e. sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), sodium chloride (NaCl), citric acid (H(3)Cit), acetic acid (AcOH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), acetone (Me2CO) and ethanol (EtOH), under three condition sets resulting in treatments of varying intensity, depending on process duration, reagent dosage and temperature.

Enhanced nitrogen distribution and biomethanation of kitchen waste by thermal pre-treatment,"The effects of thermal pretreatment (90, 120, 140 and 160 degrees C) on the morphology (organic and inorganic nitrogen) and distribution properties (in solid phase, liquid phase and gas phase) of nitrogen in kitchen waste (KW) and on anaerobic digestion performance were investigated. The results show that thermal pretreatment could efficiently enhance the solubilisation of organic nitrogen compounds in KW, especially at high temperatures and long heating durations. Approximately 3.0-47.9% of organic nitrogen in KW decreases in total nitrogen content was obtained in the solid phase after thermal pretreatment. Higher biogas production and biodegradability of organics (in terms of the removal rate of soluble chemical oxygen demand, total organic nitrogen, and volatile solids) during subsequent anaerobic digestion were observed compared with the levels for untreated KW. An overall economic analysis indicates that the most profitable pretreatment process was achieved at 90 and 120 degrees C for treatment time of 30 and 15 min respectively, with a net potential profit (2-8 (sic) ton(-1) kW).

ADM1 calibration using BMP tests for modeling the effect of autohydrolysis pretreatment on the performance of continuous sludge digesters,"Improving anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge through pretreatment techniques is a suitable solution for better sludge management. In this sense, modeling may present itself as an important tool to assess and predict process performance and pretreatment effects. In this study, the feasibility of using biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests data for calibrating the Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) was evaluated, in order to simulate the operation of continuous digesters fed, at different HRTs, with raw and autohydrolysis-pretreated waste activated sludge. This was achieved using a simplified COD fractioning methodology proposed to define ADM1 inputs. Hydrolysis constant rates were determined as the most sensitive parameters, and estimated using BMP tests. The calibrated model was then cross-validated with continuous digesters data sets. Good model performance was attained employing these techniques. The ADM1 was able to successfully represent the consumption of slowly biodegradable organic matter in BMP tests, the changes in hydrolytic limiting steps due to the autohydrolysis pretreatment and the behavior of the continuous digesters in overall. The COD fractioning methodology and the X. variable manipulation proposed seemed to be crucial for proper model predictions. Results indicate that BMP tests are a suitable data source for ADM1 calibration, and that the model can be a powerful tool to assess the effect of the autohydrolysis pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion of sewage waste activated sludge.

Effects of pretreatment methods on biomethane production kinetics and microbial community by solid state anaerobic digestion of sugarcane trash,"Solid state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD) of lignocellulose is effective in improving biomethane productivity but is limited by low biomass digestibility and lack of substrate-specific working microorganisms. In this study, the effects of different pretreatment methods on biomethane production by SS-AD of sugarcane trash were studied. The biomethane production, fitted to a modified Gompertz's model, predicted a maximum methane yield of 214.2 L/kg volatile solids (VS) and productivity of 6.9 L/kg VS/day from KOH-pretreated trash, respectively. Microbial community analysis showed that bacterial community was significantly associated with volatile acids and pretreatment types while archaeal community was significantly associated with methane yield. Microbial community dynamics was revealed in SS-AD. Main genera related to pretreatment method were identified and discussed.

Thermal hydrolysis of sewage sludge partially removes organic micropollutants but does not enhance their anaerobic biotransformation,"Pretreatment technologies prior to anaerobic digestion (AD) have been developed with the aim of enhancing bio-gas productivity and reducing the presence of pathogens in digested sludge. Among them, thermal hydrolysis (TH) appears as the most promising one. In wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) sludge is the end point of many organic micropollutants (OMPs), which was proved to lead to important environmental and human risks since sludge is commonly used in agriculture. The objective of this work is to determine the fate OMPs in TH and subsequent AD. Sewage sludge was pretreated in a TH pilot plant at 170 degrees C for 20 min. Afterwards, two anaerobic digesters with a working volume of 14 L fed with fresh and pretreated sludge were operated in parallel in mesophilic conditions. TH proved to be an effective technology to partially or totally remove the dissolved fraction of OMPs as well as the fraction sorbed into those suspended solids that are solubilised after this pretreatment. However, it did not affect the OMPs sorbed concentration into solids that are not solubilised. Globally, the OMPs removal efficiency during TH appears to be linked to the solids solubilisation during this process. Afterwards, the OMPs biotransformation efficiency in AD of fresh and pretreated sludge was determined. Noticeable differences between the microbiome of both reactors was determined, but the anaerobic biotransformation was not substantially different for most of the OMPs. However, it affected musk fragrances, which presented considerably lower biotransformation efficiency in the reactor fed with pretreated sludge. Therefore, TH was proved effective in partially removing OMPs but not in enhancing their bioavailability and subsequent anaerobic biotransformation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

"Sequential ultrasound and low-temperature thermal pretreatment: Process optimization and influence on sewage sludge solubilization, enzyme activity and anaerobic digestion","The influence of sequential ultrasound and low-temperature 55 degrees C) thermal pretreatment on sewage sludge solubilization, enzyme activity and anaerobic digestion was assessed. The pretreatment led to significant increases of 427-1030% and 230-674% in the soluble concentrations of carbohydrates and proteins, respectively, and 1.6-4.3 times higher enzymatic activities in the soluble phase of the sludge. Optimal conditions for chemical oxygen demand solubilization were determined at 59.3 kg/L total solids TS) concentration, 30,500 kJ/kg TS specific energy and 13 h thermal treatment time using response surface methodology. The methane yield after pretreatment increased up to 50% compared with the raw sewage sludge, whereas the maximum methane production rate was 1.3-1.8 times higher. An energy assessment showed that the increased methane yield compensated for energy consumption only under conditions where 500 kJ/kg TS specific energy was used for ultrasound, with up to 24% higher electricity recovery.

"Sequential ultrasound and low-temperature thermal pretreatment: Process optimization and influence on sewage sludge solubilization, enzyme activity and anaerobic digestion","The influence of sequential ultrasound and low-temperature 55 degrees C) thermal pretreatment on sewage sludge solubilization, enzyme activity and anaerobic digestion was assessed. The pretreatment led to significant increases of 427-1030% and 230-674% in the soluble concentrations of carbohydrates and proteins, respectively, and 1.6-4.3 times higher enzymatic activities in the soluble phase of the sludge. Optimal conditions for chemical oxygen demand solubilization were determined at 59.3 kg/L total solids TS) concentration, 30,500 kJ/kg TS specific energy and 13 h thermal treatment time using response surface methodology. The methane yield after pretreatment increased up to 50% compared with the raw sewage sludge, whereas the maximum methane production rate was 1.3-1.8 times higher. An energy assessment showed that the increased methane yield compensated for energy consumption only under conditions where 500 kJ/kg TS specific energy was used for ultrasound, with up to 24% higher electricity recovery.

Effects of thermal pretreatment on acidification phase during two-phase batch anaerobic digestion of kitchen waste,"The effect of thermal pretreatment (55-160 degrees C) on the degradation characteristics of kitchen waste during anaerobic fermentation at medium temperature was investigated. The breakdown of both organics and inorganics and the enhancement of biogas production in batch tests caused by thermal pretreatment during subsequent anaerobic fermentation were examined. Considering the effect of the acidification products and ammonia nitrogen in the acidification phase on subsequent biogas production, the influencing factors and related characteristics of various fermentation types were investigated. The results indicate that thermal pretreatment cannot only promote the anaerobic degradability of KW and the biogas production from MW but can also reduce the retention time necessary for anaerobic acidification by five days. At 50-70 degrees C and 140-160 degrees C, the biogas production and organic removal rates of the subsequent anaerobic digestion process decreased slightly, whereas at 90 and 120 degrees C, superior results were achieved during digestion.

Enhanced methane production from wool textile residues by thermal and enzymatic pretreatment,"Methane production from two types of wool textile wastes (TW1 and TW2) was investigated. To improve the digestibility of these textiles, different pretreatments were applied, and comprised thermal treatment (at 120 C for 10 min), enzymatic hydrolysis (using an alkaline endopeptidase at different levels of enzymatic loading, at 55 C for 0, 2, and 8 h), and a combination of these two treatments. Soluble protein concentration and sCOD (soluble chemical oxygen demand) were measured to evaluate the effectivity of the different pretreatment conditions to degrade wool keratin. The sCOD as well as the soluble protein content had increased in both textile samples in comparison to untreated samples, as a response to the different pretreatments indicating breakdown of the wool keratin structure. The combined treatments and the thermal treatments were further evaluated by anaerobic batch digestion assays at 55 C. Combined thermal and enzymatic treatment of TW1 and TW2 resulted in methane productions of 0.43 N m(3)/kg VS and 0.27 N m(3)/kg VS, i.e., 20 and 10 times higher yields, respectively, than that gained from untreated samples. The application of thermal treatment by itself was less effective and resulted in increasing the methane production by 10-fold for TW1 and showing no significant improvement for TW2.

Optimisation of a microwave pretreatment of wheat straw for methane production,"This study aims at the optimisation of a microwave pretreatment for wheat straw solubilisation and anaerobic biodegradability. The maximum yield of methane production was obtained at 150 degrees C with an improvement of 28% compared to an untreated sample. In addition, at this temperature, the time to reach 80% of the methane volume obtained from untreated straw was about 35%. The study of ramp time and holding time at targeted temperature showed that they had no improvement effect. Thus, the best conditions are the highest heating rate for a final temperature 150 degrees C without any holding time. The reading of energy consumed by pretreatment and energy overproduced by pretreated samples showed that increasing tVS amount and heating rate led to a saving of energy consumption. Nevertheless, to obtain a positive energy balance, a microwave device should consume less than 2.65 kJ/g(rVS). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Anaerobic digestion of biorefinery lignin: Effect of different wet explosion pretreatment conditions,"This study examine ways to make biorefinery lignin accessible for anaerobic digestion. The raw material was the residue after removing carbohydrates by Wet Explosion pretreatment at 190 degrees C and 7.5% O-2 followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. The residual solid was mainly composed of lignin and was the raw material for a second WEx pretreatment operated at 220 degrees C with 4% oxygen and variable concentrations of NaOH (0-2%). Lignin B was the residue after pretreated without NaOH, Lignin C was pretreated at 1% NaOH, and Lignin E at 2% NaOH. Anaerobic digestion was carried out on all lignin fractions (Lignin A, B, C and E) at thermophilic conditions (52 degrees C) by mixing 70% of each lignin fractions with 30% clarified manure. The results showed that the lignin samples were demethoxylated as part of the biodegradation and that the highest severity pretreatment (with oxygen and 2% NaOH) resulted in the highest methane yield.","Khan, MU; Ahring, BK",Biorefinery lignin; Anaerobic digestion; Lignin degradation; Pretreatment,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.122537,Physical,thermal,wet explosion,lignocellulose,lignin,isolate,,,,,,,,
Experimental and economical evaluation of bioconversion of forest residues to biogas using organosolv pretreatment,"The methane potential of forest residues was compared after applying organic solvent, i.e., acetic acid, ethanol, and methanol pretreatments using batch anaerobic digestion (AD). The pretreatments were performed at 190 degrees C with 50% (V/V) organic solvent for 60 min. The accumulated methane yields after 40 days of AD from pretreated forest residues were between 0.23 and 0.34 m(3) CH4/kg VS, which shows a significant improvement compared to 0.05 m(3) CH4/kg VS, from untreated forest residues. These improvements count up to 50% increase in the methane yields from the pretreated substrates based on expected theoretical yield from carbohydrates. Among the organic solvents, pretreatments with acetic acid and ethanol led to highest methane yields, i.e., over 0.30 m(3) CH4/kg VS. However, techno-economical evaluation showed, pretreatment with methanol was more viable financially. The capital investments of the plant operating 20,000 tons of forest residues varied between 56 and 60 million USD, which could be recovered in less than 8 years of operation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Influence of Anaerobic Digestion with Pretreatment on the Phytotoxicity of Sewage Sludge,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of anaerobic digestion with pretreatment on the phytotoxicity of sewage sludge. The phytotoxicity was evaluated on sewage sludge (SS) and biosolids that came from conventional anaerobic digestion (CAD) and anaerobic digestion with a pretreatment by sequential ultrasound and low-thermal hydrolysis, called advance anaerobic digestion (AAD). To compare the phytotoxicity, eight elutriate concentrations (0.5-100% v/v) from SS, CAD, and AAD were studied on three testing plants: Lactuca sativa, Raphanus sativus, and Triticum aestivum. The percentages of seed germination inhibition, root elongation, and germination index (GI) were evaluated. GI is an phytotoxicity indicator that combines seed germination and root growth, therefore reflecting a more complete estimation of toxicity. Phytotoxicity assays showed that SS, CAD, and AAD elutriates have a beneficial effect on R. sativus. Similar results were observed for T. aestivum for CAD and AAD, with GI values up to 80% in both biosolids. Only for SS, moderate toxicity was observed in T. aestivum. Moreover, L. sativa showed GI values below 50% for SS and CAD, which reflected high toxicity. Only for AAD, no presence of phytotoxic substances was observed in L. sativa. This study concluded that biosolids from AAD improved the plants' development with a GI above 78% with respect to biosolids from SS and CAD and reduced the phytotoxicity of sewage biosolid.","Venegas, M; Leiva, AM; Vidal, G",Phytotoxicity; Biosolid; Anaerobic digestion; Pretreatment; Sewage sludge,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-018-4025-5,Physical,ultrasonic,,activated sludge,sewage sludge,,,,,,,,,

Comparison and evaluation of concurrent saccharification and anaerobic digestion of Napier grass after pretreatment by three microbial consortia,"Napier grass is potentially a viable feedstock for biofuel production. The present study investigated biological pretreatment of Napier grass by three microbial consortia followed by saccharification and anaerobic digestion. The pretreatment efficiencies of three microbial consortia were compared in terms of degradation ability, saccharide and biogas yield. The lignocellulose loss rates of Napier grass varied largely. The biomass pretreated by the consortium WSD-5 gave 43.4% and 66.2% total sugar yield under low and moderate loadings of commercial enzyme mixtures, while the highest yield was 83.2% pretreated by the consortium MC1 under a high enzyme loading. The maximum methane yield of pretreated samples by the consortia MC1, WSD-5 and XDC-2 were 259, 279, 247 ml/g VS, respectively, which were 1.39, 1.49 and 1.32 times greater than the values of the untreated controls. This study showed that pretreatments by MC1, WSD-5 and XDC-2 were capable of significantly enhancing both the saccharide and methane yields from Napier grass. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Effect of sodium hydroxide pretreatment on physical, chemical characteristics and methane production of five varieties of sorghum","Sorghum bicolor [L] Moench, represents an interesting substrate for methane production. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of alkaline pretreatment on chemical composition, physical structure and methane production of five varieties of sorghum (S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5). The pretreatment was conducted in closed bottles, at 55 degrees C for 12 h. Samples were soaked in a NaOH solution at 4 and 10 gNaOH/100 gTS, with a solid concentration of 35 gTS/L. Sodium hydroxide pretreatment led to a reduction of lignin (50 -70%), hemicelluloses (18-35%), cellulose (16-45%) and galacturonic acids (up to 100%), for all varieties of sorghum, as also confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses. The reduction of lignin content and thereafter the solubilization of cellulose and hemicelluloses, previously observed, can accelerate the disintegration and the hydrolysis steps during anaerobic digestion. Indeed, an increase in the first order kinetic constant was observed by increasing the alkaline dosage (by 40%, 61%, 64%, 54%, and 40% for sorghum S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5, respectively). Nevertheless, the sodium hydroxide pretreatment had no positive effect in enhancing the methane yields (270 +/- 13, 335 +/- 11, 294 +/- 1, 327 +/- 9 and 303 +/- 24 mL CH4/gVS for S1, S2, S3, S4 and 55, respectively).

Effect of high pressure thermal pretreatment on Chlorella vulgaris biomass: Organic matter solubilisation and biochemical methane potential,"This study investigates the effect of high pressure thermal hydrolysis on organic matter solubilisation and biogas production from Chlorella vulgaris biomass. Microalgae biomass was subjected to three temperatures, namely 140, 160, and 180 degrees C and two heating times (10 and 20 min). Results showed that carbohydrates release prevailed over proteins. Carbohydrates were solubilised concomitantly with increasing temperatures. According to the infrared spectra and monomeric sugars determined in the pretreated medium, temperatures applied clearly affected the solubilisation of structural carbohydrates of the microalgae cell wall. Likewise, thermal pretreatment provided enhanced methane production with regard to the raw algal biomass. Enhanced hydrolysis rate constant supported faster biogas production. Regardless the heating time employed, increasing temperatures depicted increasing methane production. Even thought, organic matter solubilisation was greater at 180 degrees C, the anaerobic biodegradability did not show the same trend. This fact was ascribed to the formation of reaction products that hampered methane production. Best case scenario was achieved by subjecting biomass to 160 degrees C which resulted in 64% methane yield enhancement.

Improvement of Anaerobic Digestion of Hydrolysed Corncob Waste by Organosolv Pretreatment for Biogas Production,"This paper describes an organosolv pretreatment of corncob waste to improve its anaerobic digestion for biogas production. Through a thermochemical process based on the use of ethanol and acetic acid, it was possible to separate the fractions of lignin, considered to be a natural inhibitor of anaerobic digestion processes. In addition, with this organosolv pretreatment, the available sugars in the carbohydrates present as monosaccharides, or simple sugars, were depolymerised, facilitating the digestion process. The obtained results include the chemical characterisation of the corncob, the hydrolysate, and the mixture with cow manure, finding that these substrates have potential to be used in anaerobic digestion. The total reducing sugars consumed were 96.8%, and total sugars were 85.75%. It was clearly observed that with the use of pretreatment with organosolv, the production of biogas was superior, because 484 NmL/gVS was obtained compared to the other reported treatments. It was also observed that adding the hydrolysate organosolv increased the production because the values of the control without hydrolysate were 120 NmL/gVS in the bottle experiment. When the experiment was scaled to the 5L reactor, the total volumes of biogas that were accumulated in 15 days of production were 5050 NmL/gVS and 1212 NmL/gVS with and without hydrolysate, respectively. This indicates that the organosolv pretreatment of corncob waste is effective in improving biogas production.","Sulbaran-Rangel, B; Aguirre, JSA; Breton-Deval, L; del Real-Olvera, J; Tun, KJG",anaerobic digestion; methane; corn residue; organosolv pretreatment,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app10082785,Chemical,solvent,organosolv ethanol+acetic acid,lignocellulose,corn,cob,,,47,0.4,117.5,45,34,16
Hydrocyclone-induced pretreatment for sludge solubilization to enhance anaerobic digestion,"Hydrocyclone-induced pretreatment was first proposed for sludge disintegration to address excess sludge and to be served as a means of sustainable energy production. The effects of hydrocyclone disintegration alone and combination of hydrocyclone and alkaline pretreatments on sludge solubilization followed by anaerobic digestion were investigated. Initially, the flocs were disrupted through hydrocyclone at an optimal specific energy input of 0.18 W/g TS, with 2142 mg/L soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) release. The hydrocyclone induced alkaline pretreatment in different sequence was investigated subsequently, and a maximal SCOD release of 4409 mg/L was observed in combination IV, which included hydrocyclone treatment throughout and alkaline treatment from 50th min to 80th min. Mechanisms of organics release via hydrocyclone-induced sludge pretreatment were also explored, and the sludge disintegration was attributed to its anisotropic flow field as well as common actions of sheared shedding and rotation desorption. The biodegradability analysis exhibited that the optimal combined pretreated sludge also exhibited 23.75% higher levels of VFA accumulation to 1017 mg/L, 32.38% more methane production to 134.29 mL CH4/g TS and 5.9% more VSS reduction to 29.3% relative to the hydrocyclone pretreated sludge. An economic of optimal combined sludge pretreatment offers a positive net profit of 130.42 USD/ton of TS, was assessed to be a cost-effective process.","Sun, YX; Liu, Y; Zhang, YH; Huang, Y; Wang, L; Dai, L; Xu, JP; Wang, HL",Hydrocyclone; Organics release; Combined pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2019.05.159,Physical,mechanical desintegration,hydrocyclone,activated sludge,secondary sludge,,,,,,,,,
Influence of thermal pretreatment on physical and chemical properties of kitchen waste and the efficiency of anaerobic digestion,"The effects of thermal pretreatment at moderate temperatures (70, 80 and 90 degrees C) and high temperatures (120, 140 and 160 degrees C) over heating durations of 10-120 min on the physical and chemical properties of kitchen waste and on anaerobic digestion were investigated. The results show that thermal pretreatment significantly enhances the solubilisation of organic compounds (chemical oxygen demand, crude proteins, crude fats and volatile fatty acids) and their biodegradability during subsequent anaerobic digestion. High temperature and long heating duration are beneficial for the release and reduction of organic compounds, and the efficiency of subsequent anaerobic digestion is improved markedly under these conditions. Moreover, both the methane production rate and methane yield were observed to increase significantly at moderate treatment temperatures when the anaerobic digestion time was longer than 50 h.

Coupling acid pretreatment and dosing of Ni and Se enhances the biomethane potential of hazelnut skin,"This study offers new insights and promising perspectives in view of the energy valorization of hazelnut skin (HS) as a potential feedstock for renewable biomethane production. The process originally comprised the coupling of chemical pretreatments and individual dosing of cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni) and selenium (Se) as enhancement strategies of the biochemical methane potential (BMP) of HS. The anaerobic digestion (AD) of the untreated HS resulted in a biomethane production of 299 +/- 3 mL CH4.g VS-1. This was not positively nor negatively influenced by the addition of the three trace elements (TEs). Performing a 1% H2SO4 pretreatment on HS, a 104% increase of the biomethane yield (i.e. 612 +/- 20 mL CH4.g VS-1) was obtained. Under the same pretreatment conditions, a peak of 66.2 mg HAc g VS-1 of total volatile fatty acids (VFAs) was achieved. The BMP of the H2SO4-pretreated HS was further improved by 12 and 16% through the addition of 90 mu g Ni.g TS-1 and 270 mu g Se.g TS-1 of HS, respectively. The application of a 1.6% NaOH pretreatment on HS led to a 41% higher BMP (i.e. 423 +/- 24 mL CH4.g VS-1) compared to that achieved with the untreated material. However, not statistically significant effects were observed when dosing the TEs. In conclusion, a positive synergy between chemical pretreatments and TE supplementation was only observed with the H2SO4- pretreated HS. This was due to the higher VFA production and the more effective VFA conversion to methane in the presence of Ni and Se. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Performing a 1% H2SO4 pretreatment on HS, a 104% increase of the biomethane yield (i.e. 612 +/- 20 mL CH4.g VS-1) was obtained. Under the same pretreatment conditions, a peak of 66.2 mg HAc g VS-1 of total volatile fatty acids (VFAs) was achieved. The BMP of the H2SO4-pretreated HS was further improved by 12 and 16% through the addition of 90 mu g Ni.g TS-1 and 270 mu g Se.g TS-1 of HS, respectively. The application of a 1.6% NaOH pretreatment on HS led to a 41% higher BMP (i.e. 423 +/- 24 mL CH4.g VS-1) compared to that achieved with the untreated material. However, not statistically significant effects were observed when dosing the TEs. In conclusion, a positive synergy between chemical pretreatments and TE supplementation was only observed with the H2SO4- pretreated HS. This was due to the higher VFA production and the more effective VFA conversion to methane in the presence of Ni and Se. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparative Study of Chemical Pretreatments of Dairy Manure for Enhanced Biomethane Production,"Dairy manure containing partially digested plant cells is an inexpensive bioenergy feedstock. The carbohydrates and lignin that remain after digestion are typically processed in an anaerobic digester to produce biomethane, but due to the remaining material's recalcitrance, the process has a low conversion efficiency. To improve the conversion of this lignocellulosic material, chemical, thermal, or biological pretreatments can be considered. This study compared several chemical pretreatments including dilute acid, sulfite, and alkali pretreatments for dairy manure as a bioenergy feedstock and analyzed their impact on biomethane production. The comparative study showed that a hot alkali pretreatment (180 degrees C, 30 min) can improve the methane production of dairy manure by 50%, which is more effective than dilute acid (6.8%), sulfite (26.3%), and cold or ambient alkali (19.8 to 32.8%) pretreatments.

Wheat straw pretreatment with KOH for enhancing biomethane production and fertilizer value in anaerobic digestion,"Wheat straw biode gradability during anaerobic digestion was improved by treatment with potassium hydroxide (KOH) to decrease digestion time and enhance biomethane production and fertility value. KOH concentrations of 1% (K1), 3% (K2), 6% (K3) and 9% (K4) were tested for wheat straw pretreatment at ambient temperature with a C:N ratio of 25: 1. 86% of total solids (TS), 89% of volatile solids (VS) and 22% of lignocellulose, cellulose and hemicellulose (LCH) (22%) were decomposed effectively with the wheat straw pretreated by 6% KOH. Enhanced bio-gas production and cumulative biomethane yield of 258 ml.(g VS)(-1) were obtained increased by 45% and 41% respectively, compared with untreated wheat straw. Pretreated wheat straw digestion also yielded a digestate with higher fertilizer values potassium (138%), calcium (22%) and magnesium (16%). These results show that TS, VS and LCH can be effectively removed from wheat straw pretreated with KOH, improving biodegradability biomethane production and fertilizer value.

Valorization of Arid Region Abattoir Animal Waste: Determination of Biomethane Potential,"Abattoir waste methanization has historically focused on cattle, swine and poultry wastes. The main objective of the present work is the determination of biomethane potential of organic wastes from arid-region, i.e. animal dung: camel, sheep, goat, cattle; and mixed blood waste. Biomethane potential was determined for the five untreated wastes. In addition the investigated wastes were thermally pretreatment at 120 degrees C for 30min and the biomethane potentials of the pretreated wastes were in addition determined. The thermal pretreatment increased the biomethane potential by 30-150%, achieving a maximum of 442mlCH(4)/gVS for the thermally pretreated mixed blood waste. The results highlight the potential of using abattoir wastes in arid-regions for biomethane production. Two mathematical models, Gompertz, and modified Gompertz, were used to analyze the experimental data and determine the maximum biomethane production rate. The analysis showed that the modified Gompertz model is more accurate than the Gompertz model giving at biomethane production rate up to 56mlCH(4)/gVS/day.

Improved valorization of sewage sludge in the circular economy by anaerobic digestion: Impact of an innovative pretreatment technology,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) of sewage sludge shows low carbon conversion efficiency (CCE) due to the poor biodegradability of sewage sludge. The lack of digestibility is specifically linked to the waste-activated sludge (WAS) making up the majority of sewage sludge along with a smaller portion of primary sludge, depending on the wastewater treatment plant configuration. In this study, we examine the Advanced Wet Oxidation & Steam Explosion process (AWOEx) for improving the CCE of digested sewage sludge (DSS) by thermophilic AD. The effect of the pretreatment temperature in the range between 160 and 185 degrees C at a fixed residence time of 20 min with and without oxygen added at a dosage of 5 % of the organics present was tested. Methane yield improved by 97.92 % to 183.91 +/- 4.93 mL/g vS over the untreated DSS (control), whose methane yield was 92.92 +/- 9.07 mL/g vS We have demonstrated for the first time that 84 % of the organics in sewage sludge can successfully be transformed into biogas following AWOEx pretreatment, which can contribute significantly to the circular economy instead of greenhouse gas emissions from landfilling.","Dutta, N; Giduthuri, AT; Khan, MU; Garrison, R; Ahring, BK",Enhanced anaerobic digestion; Sewage sludge pretreatment; Advanced wet -oxidation and steam explosion; Thermophilic anaerobic digestion; Optimization of pretreatment,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2022.09.035,Chemical,oxidizer,wet oxidation awoex,activated sludge,sewage sludge,,,,,,,,,
Hydrothermal pretreatment of source separated organics for enhanced solubilization and biomethane recovery,"The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of the hydrothermal pretreatment on the solubilization of source separated organics (SSO) as well as the biomethane recovery through the mesophilic batch anaerobic digestion process. For this purpose, the SSO was subjected to fifteen different pretreatment conditions within five different severity index (SI) values (3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, and 5). The pretreatment temperature, holding time, and pressure ranged from 150 to 240 degrees C, 5 to 30 min, and 476 to 3367 kPa, respectively. The highest solubilization improvement of similar to 50% was achieved under the pretreatment condition of 220 degrees C-10 min-2323 kPa corresponding to the SI value of 4.5. However, the maximum biomethane production yield of 280 mL/g TCODadded and biomethane production rate of 30 mL/g TCODadded were obtained under the less intense pretreatment conditions of 190 degrees C-20 min-1247 kPa and 170 degrees C-30 min-786 kPa, respectively.","Razavi, AS; Koupaie, EH; Azizi, A; Hafez, H; Elbeshbishy, E",Anaerobic digestion; Biomethane; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Solubilization; Source separated organics,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.12.024,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,ofmsw,source separated organics,,,,,,,,,
Optimization of sugarcane bagasse autohydrolysis for methane production from hemicellulose hydrolyzates in a biorefinery concept,"This study aimed to optimize through design of experiments, the process variables (temperature - T, time - t and solid-to-liquid ratio - SLR) for sugarcane bagasse (SB) autohydrolysis (AH) to obtain hemicellulose hydrolyzates (HH) prone to anaerobic digestion (AD) and biochemical methane production (BMP). The results indicated that severe AH conditions, which lead to maximum hemicelluloses dissolution and sugar content in the HH, were not the best for BMP, probably due to the accumulation of toxic/recalcitrant compounds (furans and lignin). Mild AH conditions (170 degrees C, 35 min and SLR = 0.33) led to the highest BMP (0.79 Nm(3) kg TOC (1)), which was confirmed by the desirability tool. HH produced by AH carried out at the desired condition DC2 (178.6 degrees C, 43.6 min and SLR = 0.24) showed the lowest accumulation of inhibitory compounds and volatile fatty acids (VFA) and highest BMP (1.56 Nm(3) kg TOC (1)). The modified Gompertz model best fit the experimental data and led to a maximum methane production rate (R) of 2.6 mmol CH4 d (1) in the best condition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Determining Optimal Temperature Combination for Effective Pretreatment and Anaerobic Digestion of Corn Stalk,"Temperature is one of the important factors affecting both chemical pretreatment and anaerobic digestion (AD) process of corn stalk (CS). In this work, the combined ways between pretreatment temperature (40 degrees C and 60 degrees C) and AD temperature (35 degrees C and 55 degrees C) were selected to investigate the AD performance for sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pretreated CS. Three organic loading rates (OLRs) of 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0 g center dot L-1 center dot d(-1) were studied within 255 days using continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTR). The results revealed that biogas yields of CS after pretreated were higher than that of untreated groups by 36.79-55.93% and 11.49-32.35%, respectively. When the temperature of NaOH pretreatment changed from 40 degrees C to 60 degrees C, there was no significant difference in enhancing the methane yields during the three OLRs. The mesophilic AD (MAD) of CS pretreated with 2% NaOH under 40 degrees C and 60 degrees C conditions produced 275 and 280 mL center dot g(vs)(-1) methane yield at OLR of 1.6 g center dot L-1 center dot d(-1). However, as the OLR increased, the methane yield of CS under thermophilic AD (TAD) condition was further higher than under MAD condition. Furthermore, from the perspectives of energy balance and economic analysis, AD of 40 degrees C-treated CS recovered more energy and TAD is less expensive. Therefore, temperature of 40 degrees C was considered as an appropriate for pretreatment whether in mesophilic or thermophilic AD system.

Biomethanization of solid wastes from the alcoholic beverage industry: Malt and sloe. Kinetic and microbiological analysis,"Barley malt and sloe are two raw materials used in the production of beer and pacharan (a Spanish spirit drink), respectively. These organic wastes have been used as substrate of anaerobic digestion to assess the effect of temperature (35 degrees C and 55 degrees C) and thermal pretreatment (80 degrees C for 1.5 h). Viable microbiological isolates have also been identified through metabolic tests and a kinetic model which includes biogas generation and volatile solids (VS) removal has been proposed. Temperature studies on barley malt yielded higher productivities at 55 degrees C (the ratio of produced biogas volume per VS consumed was 119% higher than that at 35 degrees C), but similar VS removal (0.9% less elimination at 55 degrees C). On the other hand, sloe digestion was more effective at 35 degrees C (biogas/VS-consumed ratio 252% higher than that at 55 degrees C), while VS elimination can be considered the same. Attending to the effect of thermal pretreatment on productivity, barley malt showed no improvement while sloe was enhanced (144% at 35 degrees C and 160% at 55 degrees C). Kinetic modelling fits to the experimental results, showing differences in maximum specific growth rate of biomass according with the temperature conditions. In all cases the adjustment was good (R-2 > 0.96). Microbiological characterization identified bacterial population, both strict and facultative anaerobes.","de Diego-Diaz, B; Fernandez-Rodriguez, J; Vitas, AI; Penas, FJ",Anaerobic digestion; Thermal pretreatment; Solid wastes; Malt; Sloe,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2017.10.075,Physical,thermal,,lignocellulose,spent grains,spent grains,25,25,,,,,,
Ozonolysis of straw from Secale cereale L. for anaerobic digestion,"The effect of different ozonation conditions on straw from Secale cereale (rye straw) pretreatment has been investigated. Using the Taguchi method, this study analyzed the optimum conditions for pretreatment of rye straw by ozonation. After 60 min of rye straw ozonation the concentration of reducing sugars (RS) and volatile fatty acid (VFA), chemical oxygen demand (COD) were 7.4, 32.3 and 11.7 times higher, respectively compared to samples raw rye straw. The most effective rye straw ozonation occurred while using the highest amount of the rye straw (15 g) treated with lower ozone dose (100 gO(3)/m(3)) in the longest period of time (60 min). For this variant of experiment the increment of methane production was 291.71 dm(3) CH4/kg VS. Moreover, co-digestion of sewage sludge with addition of 20% ozonated rye straw allowed to obtain 269.1 dm(3) CH4/kg VS.

Effect of microwave pretreatment on semi-continuous anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge,"Sewage sludge is a waste produced worldwide in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) that constitutes a major environmental and health problem.

In this study at laboratory scale, the semi-continuous anaerobic digestion of raw sewage sludge and pretreated sewage sludge were compared in terms of organic loading rate (OLR), biodegradability and methane production. The main results were found to be OLR up to 2.80 x 10(-5) kg TVS (Total Volatile Solids)/m(3).s, 70% biodegradability and a 20% improvement in methane yield compared to sewage sludge without pretreatment.

Anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge - comparison of thermal pretreatments with thermal inter-stage treatments,"BACKGROUND: Treatment methods for improved anaerobic digestion (AD) of waste activated sludge were evaluated. Pretreatments at moderate thermal (water bath at 80 degrees C), high thermal (loop autoclave at 130-170 degrees C) and thermo-chemical (170 degrees C/pH 10) conditions prior to AD in batch vials (40 days/37 degrees C) were compared with inter-stage treatments under the same conditions carried out between two separate steps of AD (19-21 days/37 degrees C). Combined treatment at 80 degrees C with CO(2)/NH(3)-stripping was also evaluated. RESULTS: Pretreatment at 80 degrees C had no effect on methane yield while inter-stage treatment gave a 20% increase, compared with controls. Combining inter-stage treatment with CO(2)/NH(3)-stripping gave an increase in pH (7.1 to 9.3), a drop in ammonia-N concentration (910 mg-N to 510 mg-N) and a methane yield improvement of 31%. Pretreatment at 130 degrees C, 170 degrees C and 170 degrees C/pH 10 considerably increased the methane production within the first 4 days but the improvement following 40 days of digestion was only 13%, 9% and 2%, respectively. In comparison, inter-stage treatment led to improvements of 9% (130 degrees C), 29% (170 degrees C) and 28% (170 degrees C/pH 10). All treatment processes increased sludge solubilization. CONCLUSION: Thermal treatment of waste activated sludge for improved anaerobic digestion seems more effective when applied as an inter-stage treatment rather than a pretreatment.

Significance of Pretreatment in Enhancing the Performance of Dry Anaerobic Digestion of Food Waste: An Insight on Full Scale Implementation Strategy with Theoretical Analogy,"The aim of this study was to treat food waste containing 25% total solids (TS) through dry anaerobic digestion (dry AD) process at various pressures (0.5 to 2.5 kg/cm(2)) and different time duration (20 to 100 min) to understand the impact of pretreatment in enhancing the methane generation potential along with insights on scale up. The findings revealed that vs. reduction and methane yield of 60% and 0.25 L CH4/(g VSadded) can be achieved with pretreated food waste at two kilograms per square centimeter, while pretreatment of food waste at 2 kg/cm(2)for 100 min enhanced the vs. reduction from 60% to 85% and methane yield from 0.25 to 0.368 L CH4/(g VSadded). However, the net energy indicated that 40 min of pre -treatment at two kilograms per square centimeter can be a suitable option as methane yield and vs. reduction of 0.272 L CH4/(g VSadded) and 70%, respectively was achieved. The vs. reduction and the methane yield of 45% and 0.14 L CH4/(g VSadded), respectively was obtained from untreated food waste which illustrated that pretreatment had significantly impacted on the enhancement of methane generation and organic matter removal which can make the dry AD process more attractive and feasible at commercial scale.","Arelli, V; Juntupally, S; Begum, S; Anupoju, GR",food waste; dry anaerobic digestion; pretreatment; methane yield,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr8091018,Physical,pressure,,food waste,canteen,,,,,,,,,

Rheological properties of sewage sludge during enhanced anaerobic digestion with microwave-H2O2 pretreatment,"The rheological behavior of sludge is of serious concern in anaerobic digestion. This study investigated the rheological properties of sewage sludge during enhanced anaerobic digestion with microwave-H2O2 pretreatment (MW-H2O2). The results showed that MW-H2O2 pretreatment resulted in the improvement of sludge flowability and weakening of its viscoelastic properties. Further positive effects on the rheological properties of digested sludge during anaerobic digestion were observed. The flowability was improved with a low level of apparent viscosity. The decrease of the consistency index and increase of the flow behavior index indicated that the strength of the inner structures and non-Newtonian flow characteristics of digested sludge weakened. Both the storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G) decreased, indicating that the viscoelastic behavior became weak. These effects were possibly attributed to the changes of the digested sludge micro-structures, such as extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). This study concluded that anaerobic digestion for treating sewage sludge combined with pretreatment is a more favorable option than single anaerobic digestion from the perspective of rheology.

The Effect of a Short Term Aerobic Pretreatment Step on the Anaerobic Co-digestion of the Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Wastes: Liquid Extract Addition Versus Solid Phase Addition,"Goal of the work was to study the effect of mixing aerobically pretreated organic municipal solid wastes (OFMSW) with raw OFMSW in an anaerobic digestion process. The optimum time of aerobic pretreatment was found to be five days, as this was indicated via biological activity measurements (oxygen uptake rate, enzymatic activities, temperature). The aerobically pretreated wastes or a liquid extract from those pretreated wastes were, each separately, mixed with simulated OFMSW in various experiments. The mixtures were anaerobically digested for 28 days and five different treatments were performed including the blanks. The methane generation results were fitted to a typical anaerobic model to calculate theoretical maximum methane potential, maximum methane generation rate and theoretical lag time. Results indicated that the addition of 5-day aerobically pretreated OFMSW in solid form to raw OFMSW resulted in a 18 % net increase of the methane production. The Rmax was also increased by 39 % while no significant differences in the lag time of the methanogenic phase were observed. The addition of the liquid extract that was obtained from the 5-day pretreated OFMSW did not result in a statistically significant increase of the net methane production of the raw OFMSW.","Martinez-Valdez, F; Komilis, D; Saucedo-Castaneda, G; Barrena, R; Sanchez, A",Anaerobic digestion; OFMSW; Co-digestion; Enzymes; Aerobic pretreatment,2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-016-9743-6,Biological,aerobic,,ofmsw,municipal solid waste,,,,,,,,,
Anaerobic digestion of ammonia-pretreated corn stover,"The effect of ammonia pretreatment on the anaerobic digestibility of corn stover was investigated. Corn stover with different moisture contents (30%, 50%, 70%, and 90%) was pretreated with three concentrations of ammonia (2%, 4%, and 6%) at 35 +/- 2 degrees C for the following batch digestion. Results showed that the reagent of 4% ammonia and 70% moisture content could achieve the highest anaerobic digestibility. In comparison with the untreated, the time needed to produce 90% of the maximum digester gas production (T-90) shortened from 52 d to 37 d. The total biogas production and the unit volatile solids (VS) biogas yield were 20,740 ml and 427.1 ml respectively, both 26.70% higher than the untreated. It was found that the digesters with high moisture contents of 70% and 90% were more stable and had shorter acidification periods relative to the low moisture contents of 30% and 50%. The decreases in cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin indicated that ammonia pretreatment could destroy the lignocellulose (LCH) structure and furthermore enhance the biogas production. Following anaerobic digestion, 80.6% of cellulose and 68.52% of hemicelluloses were consumed where there was 4% ammonia and 70% moisture content, indicating why these conditions produced the highest level of biogas.

Thermal pretreatment to improve methane production of Scenedesmus biomass,"Research into the development of renewable and sustainable fuels has been a major concern during last decades. Microalgae, as a potential resource, have gained great attention for energy purposes. In this context, anaerobic digestion seems to be the most direct energy generation process. Nevertheless, the efficiency of this process is hampered due to the hard cell wall of some microalgae. In order to enhance its anaerobic biodegradability, the present research investigated the effect of thermal pretreatment at two temperatures (70 and 90 degrees C) applied to Scenedesmus biomass. No differences were detected in terms of organic matter or ammonium release upon the two tested temperatures. Nevertheless, a different fact was observed for their anaerobic biodegradability. While raw and pretreated at 70 degrees C microalgae attained 22-24% anaerobic biodegradability, microalgae pretreated at 90 degrees C achieved anaerobic biodegradability of 48%. Even though similar profiles were obtained for both temperatures along the pretreatment period, the damage caused in the cell wall at 90 degrees C seemed to be greater and rendered this substrate readily degradable for anaerobic digestion.

Continuous anaerobic digestion of zucchini stem after pretreatment,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a widely used technology for converting organic wastes into biomethane with the advantages of clean energy production and few environmental impacts. Zucchini stem (ZS), the main waste produced from zucchini cultivation, is a potential feedstock for AD due to its high moisture and organic contents. This study investigated the methane production performance and system stability of ZS in continuous AD mode with the increase of organic loading rate (OLR). Moreover, to improve the methane production efficiency, KOH, NaOH, and alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP) pretreatments were also performed. The results showed that raw ZS gave a daily methane yield (DMY) of 182.1 mL g(VS)(-1) d(-1) and volumetric methane yield (VMY) of 0.546 L L-1 d(-1) at an OLR of 3.0 g(VS) L-1 d(-1). At the same OLR, 2% KOH-pretreated ZS significantly enhanced the DMY to 236.0 mL g(VS)(-1) d(-1) and the VMY to 0.708 L L-1 d(-1), with a biodegradability (Bd) of 56.3%, which was 29.7% higher than that of raw ZS. However, NaOH-and AHP-pretreated ZS could not achieve stable methane generation at an OLR of 2.0 g(VS) L-1 d(-1).

Effect on anaerobic digestion performance of corn stover by freezing-thawing with ammonia pretreatment,"In order to enhance the biomethane production from corn stover, choosing effective pretreatment is one of the necessary steps before starting anaerobic digestion (AD). This study was aimed to analyze the effectiveness of freezing-thawing with ammonia pretreatment on substance degradation and AD performance of corn stover. Three ammonia concentrations (2%, 4%, and 6%) with two different moisture contents (50% and 70%) were used to pretreat the corn stover at two temperatures (-20 degrees C and 20 degrees C). The result showed that an optimum pretreatment condition for corn stover was at the temperature of -20 degrees C, moisture content of 70% and ammonia concentration of 2%. Under the optimum pretreatment condition, the maximum biomethane yield reached 261 ml.(g VS)(-1), which was 41.08% higher than that of the untreated. Under different pretreatment conditions, the highest loss of lignin at - 20 degrees C with 2% ammonia concentration was 63.36% compared with the untreated.

Pretreatment with rumen fluid improves methane production in the anaerobic digestion of paper sludge,"Because paper sludge discharged from the waste paper recycling process contains high levels of lignin and ash, it is not hydrolyzed effectively during anaerobic digestion. In this study, we investigated the effects of pretreatment with rumen fluid on paper sludge and on the methane fermentation process. Paper sludge was pretreated with rumen fluid at 37 degrees C for 6 h. Following pretreatment, 4.5% of the total solids in paper sludge were degraded and converted, and the dissolved chemical oxygen demand and volatile fatty acid concentration increased. Batch methane fermentation was conducted at 37 degrees C for 20 days. During methane fermentation, the degradation and hydrolysis of paper sludge were enhanced by pretreatment with rumen fluid. The amounts of total methane production from pretreated paper sludge (excluding methane generated from rumen fluid), rumen fluid and untreated paper sludge were 650.4, 819.9 and 190.8 ml, respectively. The volume of methane gas produced from pretreated paper sludge was 3.4 times larger than that from untreated paper sludge. These results indicate that pretreatment with rumen fluid enhances methane production from paper sludge.

Enhancement of biomethane production from cattle manure with codigestion of dilute acid pretreated lignocellulosic biomass,"It is well known that dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment of the lignicellulosisc biomass is an effective approach used for the production of the ethanol. However, there are less studies on the biogas production from the pretreated lignocellulosics and hardly data available on the codigestion of cattle manure with the pretreated lignocellulosisc material. The aim of this study was to evaluate biomethane production potential of codigestion of cattle manure with dilute acid pretreated lignocellulosic biomass. Sugarcane bagasse and rice husk was pretreated with dilute sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid at 121 degrees C for 20minutes and subsequently subjected to anaerobic digestion alone or codigested with cattle manure.The results showed that codigestion of 1% phosphoric acid pretreated rice husk with cattle manure led to the highest methane production of 115Nmlg(-1)VS while monodigestion of cattle manure and phosphoric acid pretreated rice husk produced 98 and 87Nmlg(-1)VS, respectively. An inhibition was observed in anaerobic digestion of sulfuric acid pretreated rice husk and sugarcane bagasse during monodigestion and codigestion with cattle manure.The study concludes that dilute phosphoric acid pretreated lignocellulosics like sugarcane bagasse and rice husk can be used as a cosubstrate with cattle manure in anaerobic digestion for enhanced methane production. Dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment, which is effective method for the bioethanol production, causes inhibition during anaerobic digestion of the pretreated lignocellulosics.","Saboor, A; Khan, S; Shah, AA; Hasan, F; Khan, H; Badshah, M",Anaerobic digestion; codigestion; lignocellulosic biomass; methane yield; pretreatment,2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15435075.2017.1313740,Chemical,acidic,h2so4,codigestion,"bagasse,rice husk,manure",,,,,,,,,

It can be seen that this treatment effectively leaded to the increase of soluble chemical oxygen demand(SCOD) and volatile fatty acids(VFA)concentration.

Impact of hydrothermal pretreatment on anaerobic digestion efficiency for lignocellulosic biomass: Influence of pretreatment temperature on the formation of biomass-degrading byproducts,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) of lignocellulosic biomass is appealing because of the abundance and ease of obtaining the biomass locally. However, the recalcitrance of lignocellulosic biomass presents an obstacle in the hydrolysis step of AD and lowers the process efficiency. In this study, sunflower, which is a model lignocellulosic biomass, was pretreated by thermal (hydrothermal pretreatment, HTP) and non-thermal (milling) methods; the methane yield and biodegradability of the pretreated biomass were determined using a series of batch tests. The thermal pretreatment method showed a significantly higher methane yield (213.87-289.47 mL g(-1) VS) and biodegradability (43-63%) than those of the non-thermally pretreated biomass, and the optimum pretreatment effect was observed at an HTP temperature of 180 degrees C. However, at an HTP temperature exceeding 200 degrees C, the induced formation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural significantly lowered the methane yield and biodegradability. This study revealed that the HTP temperature is closely related to the formation of lignocellulosic biomass-degrading byproducts, which potentially hinder the methanogenesis step in AD; severe HTP conditions may have the opposite effect on the AD performance of lignocellulosic biomass.

Enhancement of substrate solubilization and hydrogen production from kitchen wastes by pH pretreatment,"Pretreatment at different pHs was adopted in this study to enhance the substance solubilization and hydrogen production from kitchen wastes through anaerobic digestion. After a pretreatment set at pH = 13, solubilization of kitchen wastes improved substantially as the concentration of soluble carbohydrate, soluble protein, lipids and soluble chemical oxygen demand increased by 283.1%, 203.2%, 259.1% and 108.2%, respectively, as compared with those of the control. The maximum hydrogen production potential reached 105.38 mL/g VS after the pretreatment, which was 2.66 times that of the control. Furthermore, butyric acid and acetic acid were the major components in the total metabolites after fermentation, while propionic acid had a relatively low concentration. Finally, the concentration of exoprotein and exopolysaccharide within extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) kept increasing during the initial 14 and 9 hours, respectively, then decreased afterwards. However, the concentration of DNA increased throughout the whole stage. The total EPS might indirectly indicate the anaerobic digestion process. These findings may represent a feasible method for high-quality treatment of kitchen wastes.","Zhao, MX; Yan, Q; Ruan, WQ; Miao, HF; Ren, HY; Xu, Y",kitchen wastes; pH pretreatment; hydrogen; EPS; anaerobic digestion,2011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2010.482596,Chemical,alkaline,,food waste,kitchen waste,,28,26,55,3,18.3333333333333,,,
Enhancing the anaerobic digestion of corn stover by chemical pretreatment with the black liquor from the paper industry,"In this work, black liquor as a waste from paper industry was used to pretreat corn stover before anaerobic digestion. The batch mode anaerobic digestion achieved a methane production up to 260.5 mL/g VS when the corn stover was pretreated the black liquor of 12 g NaOH/L alkalinity for 24 h, which was 59.1% higher than the control. In the semi-continuous mode anaerobic digestion, black liquor pretreatment increased the buffering capacity of the digestate to maintain suitable pH and total VFA/alkalinity ratio with no adverse effect resulted from the presence of ions. The structural and chemical changes of corn stover after the pretreatment were investigated to rationalize the enhanced performance of anaerobic digestion.","Xu, HP; Li, Y; Hua, DL; Zhao, YX; Mu, H; Chen, HL; Chen, GY",Corn stover; Black liquor; Lignocellulose; Pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.123090,Chemical,alkaline,black liquour paper industry,lignocellulose,corn,stover,,,,,,,,
Comparison of Different Electricity-Based Thermal Pretreatment Methods for Enhanced Bioenergy Production from Municipal Sludge,"This paper presents results for a comprehensive study that compares the performance of three electricity-based thermal pretreatment methods for improving the effectiveness of anaerobic digestion (AD) to process municipal wastewater sludge. The study compares thermal pretreatment using conventional heating (CH), microwave (MW), and radio frequency (RF) heating techniques. The effectiveness of the pretreatment methods was assessed in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biopolymers solubilization, AD bioenergy production, input electrical energy, and overall net energy production of the sequential pretreatment/AD process. The heating applicators for the bench-scale testing consisted of a custom-built pressure-sealed heating vessel for CH experiments, an off-the-shelf programmable MW oven operating at a frequency of 2.45 GHz for MW heating experiments, and a newly developed 1 kW RF heating system operating at a frequency of 13.56 MHz for RF heating experiments. Under identical thermal profiles, all three thermal pretreatment methods achieved similar sludge disintegration in terms of COD and biopolymer solubilization as well as AD bioenergy production (p-value > 0.05). According to the energy assessment results, the application of CH and MW pretreatments resulted in overall negative energy production, while positive net energy production was obtained through the sequential pretreatment/AD process utilizing RF pretreatment.","Koupaie, EH; Johnson, T; Eskicioglu, C",anaerobic digestion; bioenergy; municipal sludge; solubilization; thermal pretreatment,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules23082006,Physical,thermal,""""",microwave,radio frequency",activated sludge,municipal sludge,,,,,,,,,
Pretreatment of food waste with high voltage pulse discharge towards methane production enhancement,"Anaerobic batch tests were performed to investigate the methane production enhancement and solid transformation rates from food waste (FW) by high voltage pulse discharge (HVPD) pretreatment. The total cumulative methane production with HVPD pretreatment was 134% higher than that of the control. The final volatile solids transformation rates of FW with and without HVPD pretreatment were 54.3% and 32.3%, respectively. Comparison study on HVPD pretreatment with acid, alkali and ultrasonic pretreatments showed that the methane production and COD removal rates of FW pretreated with HVPD were more than 100% higher than the control, but only about 50% higher can be obtained with other pretreatments.

Co-digestion Potential of Industrial Sludges with Municipal Sludge,"Anaerobic digestion found limited use in sludges from industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). So, it is of interest to assess the biodegradability and co-digestion performance of industrial sludges of biological origin alone and when mixed with municipal sludge. In this study, sludge from two different organized industrial districts (OIDs) and textile industry WWTPs are individually mixed with municipal sludge with and without ultrasound pretreatment to investigate their energy production potential and digestibility using biochemical methane potential tests. Sludges were used at different mass ratios in reactors with F/M ratio of 1. During operation, biogas amount and methane percentage were measured. Before and after reactor operation, total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and pH were measured as performance indicators of digestion. Methane production potential was highest in reactors containing only municipal sludge and lowest containing only industrial sludge. The specific methane production normalized with COD removed for OID I, OID II and textile sludges were 0.13 L/g, 0.11 L/g and 0.11 L/g, respectively; whereas average specific methane production for municipal sludge was 0.31 L/g. COD, TS and VS reductions were lower in industrial sludges compared to domestic sludge. The co-digestion reactors with mixed industrial and municipal sludge performed in accordance with the proportion of two sludges. Ultrasonication improved the digestion performance. Although adding industrial sludge reduced the observed biogas amount to lower than that expected, results show that it is possible to co-digest some industrial sludges with municipal sludge in closely coordinated additions (about < 20%).

Unlike NaOH addition, mild microwaves and ultrasonic pretreatments had no impact on lignin. However, in the case of long microwaves pretreatment (450 W-10 min), cellulose and lignin contents were reduced by 50% and 26% respectively. Similarly, the combination of ultrasonic and alkali reagent showed a positive effect on fiber degradation and lipid solubilization as well as a positive impact on methane production.

Evaluation of physicochemical pretreatment of tomato plant for aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation,"This study evaluates different hydrothermal pretreatment conditions for the tomato plant. Since these plants produce abundant waste due to their lignocellulosic content, biodegradation through anaerobic digestion is difficult. Hydrothermal pretreatment of the tomato plant was carried out at different times (0, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 60 min), with pressure and temperature conditions maintained at 394 K and 202,650 total Pa. In addition, acid and base were added to determine if they favored the hydrolysis of the lignocellulosic material. After determining the most appropriate pretreatment time for the different options (with or without chemical reagent), aerobic biodegradability was evaluated, as well as the structural changes caused by the pretreatment. From this stage of pretreatment evaluation, it was concluded that the conditions of greatest interest were 15 min (t15) hydrothermal pretreatment without the addition of chemical reagents (TPWH (t15)). The anaerobic digestion process was subsequently evaluated by comparing TPWH (t15) with the untreated tomato plant, obtaining a mean value of 0.125 +/- 0.006 and 0.097 +/- 0.010 m(STP)(3) CH4/kg TVS (total volatile solids) (STP standard temperature and pressure conditions, 273 K and 101,325 Pa), respectively, once the methane production is stabilized.","Gil, A; Siles, JA; Gutierrez, MC; Martin, MA",Hydrothermal pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Lignocellulosic waste; Tomato plant,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13399-019-00380-x,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,lignocellulose,tomato,plant,,,,,,,,
Hydrothermal pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion of washed vinegar residue,"The aim of this work was to study the acetate separation from fresh vinegar residue (FVR) to avoid inhibition of methanogenesis and hydrothermal treatment on washed vinegar residue (WVR) to enhance methane production. The optimal liquid-solid ratio was 10: 1 mL/g for the washing of FVR. The methane yields of the FVR, WVR, and washed leachate (WL) were 273 L/kg VS, 199 L/kg VS, and 306.9 L/kg COD, respectively. The optimal hydrothermal temperature was 160 degrees C for WVR, with maximum methane yield of 258.38 L/kg VS. Hydrothermal pretreatment destroyed the structure of lignocellulose and improved the hydrolysis of hemicellulose. Compared with thermophilic digestion of FVR, thermophilic digestion of 160 degrees C treated FVR, and thermophilic digestion of WVR with mesophilic digestion of WL, the thermophilic digestion of 160 degrees C treated WVR with mesophilic digestion of WL obtained the maximum total methane yield of 102.5 L/kg FVR.

Similarly, 0.5 L of mixed sludge sample in another digester was pretreated in two stages. The removal of TS was 37.7% for M pretreated sludge compared to CMU pretreated sludge of 69.1%. The removal of volatile solids for CMU pretreated sludge was 21% higher than M-pretreated one. The SCOD/TCOD ratio for both M and CMU pretreated sludge was 33% for 15 days of SRT however, percentage change in SCOD/TCOD ratio after 30 days of SRT for CMU-pretreated sludge was 40.6% more than M-pretreated sludge sample due to increased methanogenic disintegration of organics. Maximum percentage of methane produced was 71% for CMU pretreated sludge while it was only 56% for the M pretreated sludge. Nevertheless, the dewaterability measured in capillary suction time (CST) for M-pretreated sludge was better (348 s) compared to CMU-pretreated sludge (398 s) due to higher percentage of fine sludge particles in CMU pretreated sludge. The average particle size and floc size for microwave pretreated digested sludge was much bigger than that of combined microwave ultrasonic pretreated digested sludge.

Thermal pretreatment and hydraulic retention time in continuous digesters fed with sewage sludge: Assessment using the ADM1,"Thermal pretreatment is an interesting technique not only for increasing sludge biodegradability, leading to higher methane productivity, but also for improving degradation rates, allowing full-scale plants to reduce the size of digesters. In this study, the Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) was used as a tool to assess the effects of thermal pretreatment and hydraulic retention time (HRT) on the performance of three pilot-scale digesters fed with mixed sludge with/without pretreatment applied to the waste activated sludge fraction. Calibration procedures using batch tests showed an increase of up to five times in the model disintegration coefficient due to the pretreatment, and the validations performed presented good accuracy with the experimental data, with under/overestimation lower than 15% in both average and global accumulated CH4 productions. Therefore, the ADM1 demonstrated its feasibility and usefulness in predicting and assessing the behavior of the digesters under these conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Digestion liquid based alkaline pretreatment of waste activated sludge promotes methane production from anaerobic digestion,"This work proved an efficient method to significantly increase methane production from anaerobic di-gestion of WAS. This method is to reflux proper of digestion liquid into waste activated sludge pre-treatment unit (pH 9.5 for 24 h). The yield of maximum methane improved between 174.2 +/- 7.3 and 282.5 +/- 14.1 mL/g VSS with the reflux ratio of digestion liquid increasing from 0% to 20%. It was ob-served that the biodegradable organics in the digestion liquid did not affect the biological processes related to anaerobic digestion but increased methane production through reutilization. The ammonium in the digestion liquid was the main contributor to the increase in methane production via promoting sludge solubilization, but refractory organics were the major inhibitors to anaerobic digestion. It should be emphasized that the metal ions present in the digestion liquid were beneficial rather than harmful to the biological processes in the anaerobic digestion, which may be connected with the fact that certain metal ions were involved in the expression and activation of key enzymes. In addition, it was found that anaerobes in digestion liquid were another potential contributor to the enhanced anaerobic digestion.& nbsp; (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Low temperature calcium hydroxide treatment enhances anaerobic methane production from (extruded) biomass,"Ca(OH)(2) treatment was applied to enhance methane yield. Different alkali concentration, incubation temperature and duration were evaluated for their effect on methane production and COD conversion efficiency from (non-) extruded biomass during mesophilic anaerobic digestion at lab-scale. An optimum Ca(OH)(2) pretreatment for grass is found at 7.5% lime loading at 10 degrees C for 20 h (37.3% surplus), while mild (50 degrees C) and high temperatures perform sub-optimal. Ca(OH)(2) post-treatment after fast extrusion gives an additional surplus compared to extruded material of 15.2% (grass), 11.2% (maize straw) and 8.2% (sprout stem) regarding methane production. COD conversion improves accordingly, with additional improvements of 10.3% (grass), 9.0% (maize straw) and 6.8% (sprout stem) by Ca(OH)(2) post-treatment. Therefore, Ca(OH)(2) pretreatment and post-treatment at low temperature generate an additional effect regarding methane production and COD conversion efficiency.

To improve the anaerobic degradation process thermal pretreatment of brewers' spent grains (BSG) offers the opportunity to increase degradation rate and biogas yield. Aim of the work is to show the influence of the thermal pretreatment of BSG to anaerobic digestion. BSG were pretreated at different temperature levels from 100 to 200 degrees C. The biogas production of thermally pretreated BSG lies between 30 and 40% higher than for untreated reference. The temperature of the pretreatment process has a significant influence on the degradation rate or gas yield, respectively. Up to a temperature of 160 degrees C, the biogas yield rises. Temperatures over 160 degrees C result in a slower degradation and decreasing biogas yield. Substrate with and without pretreatment gave a daily biogas yield of 430 and 389 Nm(3) x kg(-1) VS, respectively. Batch analysis of the biochemical methane potential gives a total methane yield of 409.8 Nm(3) CH4 x kg(-1) VS of untreated brewers' spent grains and 467.6 Nm(3) CH4 x kg(-1) VS of the pretreated samples. For pretreatment energy balance estimation has been carried out. Without any heat recovery demand is higher than the energy surplus resulting from pretreatment of BSG. With energy recovery by heat exchanger the net energy yield could be increased to 38.87 kWh x kg(-1) FM or 8.81%.

Alkaline hydrogen peroxide pretreatment of cladodes of cactus (opuntia ficus-indica) for biogas production,"The alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP) pretreatment of cladodes of cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) for biogas production was evaluated based on the delignification of cladodes of cactus. The effects of alkaline hydrogen peroxide concentration (30% w/w solution) and the pretreatment time (3, 6, 9, and 12 h) were evaluated at pH 11.5, temperature of 30 degrees C, and 180 rpm for removal of lignin. A batch of anaerobic digestion experiments were conducted at mesophilic temperature conditions (37 +/- 1 degrees C) with the pretreated biomass. The feed stock (cladodes of cactus) used in this study contained 12.51 +/- 1.25 cellulose, 16.34 +/- 2.93% hemicellulose, and 10.45 +/- 2.31% lignin, and the balance were (carbohydrate, protein, lipid, and ash). After AHP pretreatment, the lignocellulosic content of the feed stock was changed to 12.50 +/- 1.84%, 13.63 +/- 3.23%, and 7.49 +/- 3.05% for cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin respectively. The AHP pretreatment of cladodes of cactus highly affected the lignin structure relative to cellulose and hemicellulose. The alkaline hydrogen peroxide pretreatment resulted in a higher amount of biogas produced from 877.9 +/- 15.12 ml biogas/g VS to 1613.5 +/- 10.76 ml biogas/g VS which is an 83.4% increment and decreased after 9 h treatment to 1398.8 +/- 17.8 ml biogas/g VS. In addition, the measured methane yields range from 302.48 +/- 0.33 to 602.65 +/- 3.24 ml CH4/g VS. The results showed that alkaline hydrogen peroxide pretreatment of cladodes of cactus is an effective strategy for enhance biogas yield.","Belay, JB; Habtu, NG; Ancha, VR; Hussen, AS",Cactus; Alkaline hydrogen peroxide pretreatment; Delignification; Anaerobic digestion,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08002,Chemical,alkaline,,lignocellulose,opuntia ficus-indica,cactus,,,,,,,,

Chemical Changes in Lignocellulosic Biomass (Corncob) Influenced by Pretreatment and Anaerobic Digestion (AD),"Changes in chemical composition and structure of corncob lignocellulosic biomass were investigated relative to pretreatment and anaerobic digestion. The pretreatment involved 1% and 3% sodium hydroxide, 3% and 7% sulphuric acid, as well as medium and high temperature extrusion (in 110 degrees C and in the range from 140 degrees C to 160 degrees C). The chemical components content was studied using a gravimetric method, whereas structure and relations between the carbohydrate and lignin participation were investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. It was determined that the chemical treatment, both acidic and alkaline, changed the chemical composition of corncob more significantly than the extrusion. Alkaline pretreatment contributed to significant delignification, while acidic pretreatment reduced the share of hemicelluloses and increased the proportion of lignin, the so-called pseudolignin. The composition of corncob (control and after pre-treatment) was changed after anaerobic digestion, i.e., a decreased carbohydrate substance content and a significantly increased lignin content. FTIR analysis showed changes in their structure. Although the control corncob differed from that processed by various pretreatment methods, the chemical composition of the digested pulp obtained from them was similar. The NaOH pretreatment was judged to be the preferred method for delignification of the raw material.","Stachowiak-Wencek, A; Zborowska, M; Waliszewska, H; Waliszewska, B",Biomass; Anaerobic Digestion (AD); Pretreatment; Chemical composition; FTIR,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.15376/biores.14.4.8082-8099,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,lignocellulose,corn,cob,,,,,,,,

Enhancing anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic materials in excess sludge by bioaugmentation and pre-treatment,"This study attempted to enhance anaerobic conversion of lignocellulosic materials in excess sludge by bioaugmentation and pretreatment. The results reveal that highly active lignocellulolytic microorganisms (Clostridium stercorarium and Bacteroides cellulosolvens) could be enriched from anaerobic sludge in ordinarily operated anaerobic digester (AD). Inoculating these microorganisms into AD could substantially enhance the degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose. However, this effect of bioaugmentation was shielded for raw excess sludge due to lignin incrustation in native biosolids. For this problem, pre-treatments including acid, alkali, thermal and ultrasonic methods were effectively used to deconstruct the lignin incrustation, in which thermal pretreatment was demonstrated to be the most effective one. Then, pretreatment associated with bioaugmentation was successfully used to enhance the energy conversion of lignocellulosic materials, which resulted in the degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin to 68.8-78.2%, 77.4-89% and 15.4-33.7% respectively and thus increased the CH4 production by 210-246%, compared with ordinary AD.

Effects of ozone treatment on the biodegradability of sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants,"The effects of ozone pretreatment on the biodegradability of municipal wastewater sludge were determined. Three types of experiments were conducted: anaerobic digestion, aerobic biodegradation, and denitrification using ozone-treated sludge as a carbon source. For 5 days, ozonated sludge at 0.1 gO(3)/g-SS showed about 2-3 times greater biodegradation compared to the raw sludge in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In anaerobic experiments, biodegradation increased with ozone dosage up to 0.2 gO(3)/g-SS. Further increase of ozone dosage did not improve the biodegradation. In aerobic condition, about 77% of the ozonated sludge at 0.1 gO(3)/g-SS could be biodegraded after 15 days and is compared with 36% degradation of the untreated sludge. Most of the biodegradation of the ozonated sludge occurred within 5 days while the raw sludge was biodegraded steadily throughout the experimental period. The biodegradation enhancement of ozonated sludge was confirmed in batch denitrification experiments.","Yeom, IT; Lee, KR; Lee, YH; Ahn, KH; Lee, SH",anaerobic digestion; biodegradability; ozone treatment; sludge; sludge pretreatment,2002,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2002.0641,Chemical,oxidizer,ozone,activated sludge,municipal waste sludge,,,,,,,,,
A mechanical pretreatment of waste activated sludge for improvement of anaerobic digestion system,"This study evaluated the effectiveness of sewage pretreatment as it affected the subsequent anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge (WAS). The key to this sludge pretreatment process was that microorganism cells within WAS were ruptured by mechanical jet and smash under pressurized conditions, 5-50 bar pressure. Cell rupture was estimated by soluble protein concentration (SPC) because the cytoplasm of microorganisms is mainly composed of protein. The SPC in the WAS varied significantly before and after pretreatment. In particular, cell rupture increased from 6% to 43% with the increase of the pretreated pressure (5-30bar), volatile solids concentration and thickening time of WAS. In the WAS pretreatment with long-thickening time (12h < thickening time less than or equal to 48h), cell rupture was monitored 5-10 % higher than short-thickening time (Oh <thickening time less than or equal to 12h). Generally, it was observed that higher anaerobic digestion efficiencies of WAS could be obtained according to the increase of microorganism cell rupture through mechanical pretreatment of WAS.

Heavy metals' release characteristic of sewage sludge in alkaline treatment prior to anaerobic digestion,"Alkaline pretreatment (APT) is the promising disintegration pretreatment for the anaerobic digestion (AD) of sewage sludge (SS) to improve digestion efficiency and methane yields. In this study, the heavy metals (HMs) were observed to be leached from SS in the APT process, which could lower the HMs secondary pollution risk of the residual biosolids after AD in land application. The sequential chemical extraction (SCE) experiment was performed to determine the variation in HMs' distribution prior to and after the APT. The alkaline extracts were characterized in order to elucidate the HMs' release mechanism. The APT could cause significant release of Zn and Cu with a maximum release efficiency of 96.6% +/- 4.6% and 62.7% +/- 8.4% under the condition of 1.5 mol/L NaOH and 25 celcius, respectively. The release efficiency of Zn and Cu was reduced by 63.0% and 21.7%, respectively, due to the extra addition of 0.25 mol/L NaCl at a NaOH concentration of 1.25 mol/L in the APT process. The release of Zn and Cu may be attributed to a complex process including disruption of microbial cells in SS, solubilization of organic matters bounded with metals, and the chemical leaching reaction of minerals. This study demonstrates the possibility to remove the Zn and Cu from the SS in the APT process before the AD disposal.","Hu, JL; Wu, GL; Zheng, X; Li, SM; Zhao, JX; Liang, CZ",Heavy metals; Alkaline pretreatment; Sewage sludge; Anaerobic digestion,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-022-05589-7,Chemical,alkaline,,activated sludge,sewage sludge,,,,,,,,,
Two-Stage Anaerobic Digestion of Meat Processing Solid Wastes: Methane Potential Improvement with Wastewater Addition and Solid Substrate Fermentation,"Anaerobic digestion of slaughterhouse solid wastes (SSW) and wastewater (SWW) was investigated with different mixture ratios (M-1: 25% SSW/75% SWW, M-2: 50% SSW/50% SWW and M-3: 75% SSW/25% SWW) in sequencing batch reactors at organic loading rates (OLRs) of 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 kg VS m(-3) day(-1). The best methane production potential (MPP) and volatile solids (VS) removal yield of 0.38 m(3) kg VSadded-1 and 86%, respectively, were obtained with the mixture M-1 corresponding to the highest wastewater proportion. In fact, dilution improved the hydrolysis of organic compounds, which are hardly degraded by fermentative bacteria. For this reason, a biological pretreatment of the mixture M-3 by solid substrate fermentation (SSF) using the endogenous microflora was performed. Therefore, the methanogens activity was improved significantly. At high OLR, the MPP and the VS removal yield increased by 52 and 22.7%, respectively. Results showed that the biological pre-treatment (SSF), using Bacillus and Lactobacillus bacteria, integrated to the anaerobic digestion process is an attractive strategy to improve the bioconversion of organic fraction of slaughterhouse wastes into methane.","Handous, N; Gannoun, H; Hamdi, M; Bouallagui, H",Anaerobic digestion; Slaughterhouse wastes; Biological pretreatment; Ammonia inhibition,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-017-0055-2,Biological,bacterial,"Bacillus, Lactobacillus",animal byproduct,slaughterhouse,,,,,,,,,
Anaerobic digestion of hemicellulose hydrolysate produced after hydrothermal pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse in UASB reactor,"In the context of a sugarcane biorefinery, sugarcane bagasse produced may be pretreated generating a solid and liquid fraction. The solid fraction may be used for 2G bioethanol production, while the liquid fraction may be used to produce biogas through anaerobic digestion. The aim of this study consisted in evaluating the anaerobic digestion performance of hemicellulose hydrolysate produced after hydrothermal pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse. For this, hydrothermal pretreatment was assessed in a continuous upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor operated at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 18.4 h. Process performance was investigated by varying the dilution of sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate with a solution containing xylose and the inlet organic loading rate (OLR). Experimental data showed that an increase in the proportion of hydrolysate in the feed resulted in better process performance for steps using 50% and 100% of real substrate. The best performance condition was achieved when increasing the organic loading rate (OLR) from 12 to 2.4 g COD/L.d, with an organic matter removal of 85.7%. During this period, the methane yield estimated by the COD removal would be 270 L CH4/kg COD. Nonetheless, when further increasing the OLR to 4.8 g COD/L.d, the COD removal decreased to 74%, together with an increase in effluent concentrations of VFA (0.80 g COD/L) and furans (115.3 mg/L), which might have inhibited the process performance. On the whole, the results showed that anaerobic digestion of sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate was feasible and may improve the net energy generation in a bioethanol plant, while enabling utilization of the surplus sugarcane bagasse in a sustainable manner.

BMP test on chemically pretreated sludge,"Municipal waste activated sludge (WAS) was treated with NaOH to solubilize the particulate organic matter in order to improve its digestibility when the sludge was stabilized in an anaerobic digestion process. For the WAS of 1% TS treated with 20 and 40 meq/l NaOH at ambient temperature for 24 h, the SCOD/TCOD values increased from 3.5 to 39 and 55%, respectively. Results of the BMP (biochemical methane potential) test showed that recoveries of carbon and nitrogen reached 94-105% and the methane produced was 349 ml (at 1 atm and 35 degrees C) for 1 g of COD removed. The improvement in VS removal for sludge treated with 40 meq/l of NaOH was as high as 41% over the control sludge sample, with COD removal and gas production improved by 30 and 34%, respectively, over the control. Results of the cumulative COD removal appeared to follow first-order reaction kinetics. Parameters of the first-order model such as ultimate biodegradable COD (L-u), reaction rate coefficient (k) and ultimate biodegradability (mu), were calculated using the Thomas method. The BMP test can be used as a valuable tool to study the kinetics and efficiency of anaerobic digestion processes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A two-stage anaerobic bioconversion of corn stover: Impact of pure bacterial pretreatment on methane production,"Biological pretreatment is feasible for enhancing methane generation with crop residues. Improvement of the degradation efficiency of cellulose has always been the key to improve methane yield. The role of an anaerobic and thermophilic bacterium, Caldicellulosiruptor sp. F32, on the degradation of corn stalk was investigated. A pure bacterial pretreatment system (0.20 v/v), with 20 times CFU of 2.20x108 was verified to be beneficial to the deterioration of corn stalk residues and the increase of methane output. The highest methane yield was 250.2 mL/g volatile solid, which was 28% higher than that from the untreated group. In group 4, the concentrations of glucose and volatile fatty acids were higher than those in other groups. Furthermore, the assays by Fourier transform infrared spectra and X-ray diffraction revealed that the crystallinity indexes of pretreated groups declined. Hence, biology-based pretreatment using pure bacterial system, Caldicellulosiruptor sp. F32, is a potentially effective approach to improve the degradation efficiency of lignocellulosic biomass.

Enhancement of microwave effect with addition of chemical agents in solubilization of waste activated sludge,"Microwave (MW) is a promising method for solubilization of wasted activated sludge (WAS) due to the accelerated reaction rates, environmental friendliness and low overall cost compared to conventional heating. In this study, to enhance the MW effect on solubilization of WAS, several chemical agents were applied including H2SO4 as the acidic material and NaCl and CaCl2 as ionic materials. In the experiment of salt-assisted MW pretreatment, CaCl2 turned out to be ineffective on WAS solubilization, whereas NaCl had a positive effect on WAS solubilization compared to that of MW only assisted pretreatment. Thus, NaCl was considered to be appropriate salt to assist MW pretreatment for WAS solubilization. In the chemically assisted MW pretreatments, H2SO4 assisted MW pretreatment was the most effective for WAS solubilization. However, the application of H2SO4 to MW pretreatment has the drawbacks of reuse, which may increase the operating costs. Thus, food wastewater was used for enhancement of MW efficiency on WAS solubilization due to its high NaCl and acidity. As a result, the application of food wastewater to WAS afforded the solubilization efficiency higher than that of MW-H2SO4 pretreatment.

Improved methane production from corn straw by microaerobic pretreatment with a pure bacteria system,"Thermophilic microaerobic pretreatment has been proved to be efficient in improving methane production of corn straw in previous studies. In this study, the effect of mesophilic (37 degrees C) microaerobic pretreatment using Bacillus Subtilis on the anaerobic digestion of corn straw was explored. Microaerobic pretreatment with a pure bacteria system was beneficial for the anaerobic digestion of corn straw, which obviously improved the methane yield. The maximum methane yield of 270.8 mL/g VS was obtained at the oxygen load of 5 mL/g VS, which was 17.35% higher than that of untreated group. Groups with mesophilic microaerobic pretreatment obtained higher glucose and VFAs concentrations, as well as higher peroxidase activities after 24 h pretreatment. In addition, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis displayed the crystallinity indexes of pretreated groups were also decreased. Therefore, microaerobic pretreatment with a pure bacteria system (Bacillus Subtilis) is an efficient pretreatment method to enhance the anaerobic digestion efficiency of cellulosic biomass.","Xu, WY; Fu, SF; Yang, ZM; Lu, J; Guo, RB",Anaerobic digestion; Microaerobic pretreatment; Corn straw; Bacillus Subtilis,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.02.046,Biological,bacterial,Bacillus Subtilis microaerobic,lignocellulose,corn,straw,,,,,,,,
Efficacy of methanogenic biomass acclimation in mesophilic anaerobic digestion of ultrasound pretreated sludge,"Methanogenic biomass plays a key role with regard to methane production during anaerobic bioconversion of organic substrates. In this study, the effect of two different acclimated inocula on digestion performances was investigated by means of anaerobic batch tests on untreated and sonicated waste-activated sludge. Organics solubilization and removal kinetics, the abundance and physiological conditions of archaeal cells on ultimate methane yield were evaluated. The simultaneous presence of Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta in the archaeal biomass, the higher initial archaeal cells relative abundance and their occurrence in the aggregated forms were the main factors positively affecting the conversion into methane. The presence of the acclimated inoculum at the start-up influenced positively the methane improvement due to sonication, and the methane-specific production increased from 0.335 +/- 0.03 to 0.420 +/- 0.05Nm(3)/kg VSfed. Moreover, the better physiological state of methanogens permitted to appreciate the effect of hydrolysis improvement by ultrasound pretreatment.","Gagliano, MC; Gallipoli, A; Rossetti, S; Braguglia, CM",Anaerobic digestion; inoculum; methane; microbial composition; ultrasound pretreatment,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2017.1327555,Physical,ultrasonic,,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,19,10,,,,,,
The efficiency of shredded and briquetted wheat straw in anaerobic co-digestion with dairy cattle manure,"Anaerobic co-digestion of cattle manure (CM) with shredded or briquetted wheat straw (SS and BS, respectively) was evaluated in thermophilic continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTR) in two experiments (lab and full-scale). Three lab-scale CSTR (15 l) were used with 20 days hydraulic retention time (HRT); one was fed with CM and the other two with mixtures of CM (95% of fresh matter, FM) and SS or BS (5% FM). In the second experiment, two full-scale CSTR (30 m(3)) were operated with 25 days HRT; one reactor was fed with CM and the other with CM + BS (9% FM). Ultimate CH4 yield was analysed from each substrate. Biochemical CH4 potential at 21 days for CM, SS and BS were 128; 187 and 200 l(STP)[CH4] kg(-1) [VS]. Anaerobic digestion of CM, CM + SS and CM + BS in lab-scale reactors yielded 165; 214 and 217 l(STP) [CH4] kg(-1) [VS]. In full scale-reactors, CM and CM + BS yielded 264 and 351 l(STP) [CH4] kg(-1) [VS]. Increments of 31 and 33% on CH4 yield were achieved in CM + BS compared to CM in lab and full-scale reactors, respectively. Regarding the energy balance, the energy yields were the same for both reactors using straw as co-substrate (CM + SS and CM + BS) after subtracting the energy consumption of the pretreatment, corresponding to 1100 kWh of net energy output. However, briquetting technology could be advantageous for biogas plants where the straw might be transported over longer distances, due to reduction of the transportation costs. (C) 2015 IAgrE.

Enhancement of methane yield from cotton stalks by mechanical pre-treatment,"Cotton stalks (CS) are lignocellulosic agricultural by-products, a potential source for biogas production, but pretreatment must be considered since hydrolysis is the rate-limiting stage for lignocellulosic biomass substrates. This study investigates the feasibility of mechanical pretreatment of CS to enhance methane production. Batch anaerobic digestion of CS samples with particle sizes ranging from 0.5 to 65 mm was carried out in 1 L eudiometer batch digesters for 48 days at 37 degrees C. Results showed that methane yield was inversely proportional to particle size, and the quality of biogas was good (54.0-55.2% CH4). Significant increases in methane yield were observed with 20.3% and 26% for samples with a particle size of 3 mm and 0.5 mm, respectively, compared to untreated CS. The coefficient of anaerobic energy turnover was relatively low (20.2-25.5%). Reduction of the CS particle size to 3 mm or less is recommended to achieve effective methane conversion and decrease the retention time in an anaerobic digester from 31 to about 25 days. However, to offset the high energy demand required for grinding, further research should be conducted in combining size reduction with chemical and physicochemical pretreatment.","Al Afif, R; Pfeifer, C",Cotton stalks; Anaerobic digestion; Methane yield; Mechanical pretreatment,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crcon.2021.04.003,Physical,mechanical desintegration,size reduction,lignocellulose,cotton,stalks,95,92,56,0.95,59,,,

Ozone pretreatment of olive mill wastewaters (OMW) and its effect on OMW biochemical methane potential (BMP),"The possibility of coupling a physicochemical pretreatment (ozonation) with a biological treatment (anaerobic digestion) was investigated for the case of olive mill wastewaters (OMW). Batch ozonation experiments were performed in a glass bubble reactor. The parameters which were tested included the ozone concentration in the inlet gas stream, the reactor temperature and the composition of the liquid medium in terms of raw or fractionated OMW used. In the sequel, ozone-pretreated OMW samples were tested for their biochemical methane potential (BMP) under mesophilic conditions and these results were compared to the BMP of untreated OMW. The ozonation process alone resulted in a 57-76% decrease of total phenols and a 5-18% decrease of total carbohydrates contained in OMW, depending on the experimental conditions. Nevertheless, the ozone-pretreated OMW exhibited lower chemical oxygen demand removal and methane production during BMP testing compared to the untreated OMW.","Tsintavi, E; Pontillo, N; Dareioti, MA; Kornaros, M",anaerobic digestion; BMP; olive mill wastewater; ozonation; pretreatment,2013,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2013.560,Chemical,oxidizer,ozone,food industry organic waste,olive mill wastewater,,,,,,,,,
Effects of thermal pretreatment on degradation kinetics of organics during kitchen waste anaerobic digestion,"The influence of thermal pretreatment on degradation properties of organics in kitchen waste (KW) was investigated. The kinetics results showed that thermal pretreatment could enhance the degradation efficiency of crude protein (CP), fat, oil and grease (FOG), volatile solid (VS) and volatile fatty acids (VFA). Thermal pretreatment showed no significant difference in the final concentration of protein but could decrease the FOG degradation potential (7-36%), while increased the lag phase for degradation of protein and FOG respectively by 35-65% and 11-82% compared with untreated KW. Cumulative biogas yield increased linearly and exponentially with the removal efficiency of VS and other organics (CP and FOG) respectively. Additionally, the reduction of CP increased exponentially with FOG removal efficiency. The calculating methods of biogas yield, organics reduction and corresponding appropriate digestion retention based on FOG and CP reduction amount and pretreatment parameters were suggested.

Pretreatment of bagasse with sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid and ammonium hydroxide followed by incubations for 168 h increased fibre degradation by 11, 31 and 14%, respectively. Pretreatment of coconut fibres increased their extent of degradation by 55, 74 and 46%, respectively. Methane yield from bagasse was increased 44, 32, and 22%, and that from coconut fibres was increased by 73, 76 and 46%, respectively. With the same pretreatment, amounts of volatile fatty acids produced from bagasse and coconut fibres increased by 42, 37 and 11%, and 40, 28, and 11%, respectively. By reducing particle sizes of bagasse and coconut fibres from 5 mm to less than 0.85 mm, the extent of total fibre degradation was increased by over 40%. The yields of methane produced from these fibres increased by an average of 30%, and those of volatile fatty acids increased by about the same order of magnitude.

Ultrasonic sludge disintegration for enhanced methane production in anaerobic digestion: effects of sludge hydrolysis efficiency and hydraulic retention time,"Hydrolysis of waste activated sludge (WAS) has been regarded as the rate limiting step of anaerobic sludge digestion. Therefore, in this study, the effect of ultrasound and hydraulic residence time during sludge hydrolysis was investigated with the goal of enhancing methane production from anaerobic digestion (AD). WAS was ultrasonically disintegrated for hydrolysis, and it was semi-continuously fed to an anaerobic digesters at various hydraulic retention times (HRTs). The results of these experiments showed that the solids and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies when using ultrasonically disintegrated sludge were higher during AD than the control sludge. The longer the HRT, the higher the removal efficiencies of solids and COD, while methane production increased with lower HRT. Sludge with 30% hydrolysis produced 7x more methane production than the control sludge. The highest methane yields were 0.350 m(3)/kg volatile solids (VS)(add) and 0.301 m(3)/kg COD(con) for 16 and 30% hydrolyzed sludge, respectively. In addition, we found that excess ultrasound irradiation may inhibit AD since the 50% hydrolyzed sludge produced lower methane yields than 16 and 30% hydrolyzed sludge.","Kim, DJ; Lee, J",Anaerobic digestion; HRT; Methane production; Sludge pretreatment; Ultrasound,2012,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-011-0588-x,Physical,ultrasonic,,activated sludge,municipal sludge,,1.2,1,,,,,,
Steam Explosion Conditions Highly Influence the Biogas Yield of Rice Straw,"Straws are agricultural residues that can be used to produce biomethane by anaerobic digestion. The methane yield of rice straw is lower than other straws. Steam explosion was investigated as a pretreatment to increase methane production. Pretreatment conditions with varying reaction times (12-30 min) and maximum temperatures (162-240 degrees C) were applied. The pretreated material was characterized for its composition and thermal and morphological properties. When the steam explosion was performed with a moderate severity parameter of S-0 = 4.1 min, the methane yield was increased by 32% compared to untreated rice straw. This study shows that a harsher pretreatment at S-0 > 4.3 min causes a drastic reduction of methane yield because inert condensation products are formed from hemicelluloses.","Steinbach, D; Wust, D; Zielonka, S; Krumpel, J; Munder, S; Pagel, M; Kruse, A",steam treatment; pretreatment; lignocellulose; anaerobic digestion; biochemical methane potential; biomethane,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules24193492,Physical,thermal,steam explosion,lignocellulose,rice,straw,,,42,0.8,52.5,,,
Mechanical pretreatments of different agri-based feedstock in full-scale biogas plants under real operational conditions,"Mechanical pretreatments are commonly used devices at full-scale to reduce the size of feedstock and to increase methane production, improving mixing, heat, and mass transfer into the anaerobic digesters of biogas plants. Nevertheless, physical pretreatments require considerable energy. This work aimed to investigate how the energy consumption in different mechanical pretreatments that effectively run under real operational conditions at full-scale level affects physical modifications and anaerobic degradability of agri-based feedstock. Four mechanical pretreatment were investigated: knife milling, hammer milling, extrusion, shredding + hydrodynamic cavitation. After pretreatments, the specific methane yield increased in the range from 1% to 13% and the maximum methane production rate increased in the range from 4% to 48%. Each pretreatment leads to a positive energy balance (0.14-27 kJ kJ(-1) used). The increasing of energy consumption indicates a more intense pretreatment with an incremental reduction of particles with diameter bigger than 5 mm.

Hydrothermal Pretreatment of Wheat Straw-Evaluating the Effect of Substrate Disintegration on the Digestibility in Anaerobic Digestion,"The increasing demand for renewable energy sources and demand-oriented electricity provision makes anaerobic digestion (AD) one of the most promising technologies. In addition to energy crops, the use of lignocellulosic residual and waste materials from agriculture is becoming increasingly important. However, AD of such feedstocks is often associated with difficulties due to the high content of lignocellulose and its microbial persistence. In the present work, the effect of hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) on the digestibility of wheat straw is investigated and evaluated. Under different HTP temperatures (160-180 degrees C) and retention times (15-45 min), a significant increase in biomethane potential (BMP) can be observed in all cases. The highest BMP (309.64 mL CH4 g(-1) volatile solid (VS) is achieved after pretreatment at 160 degrees C for 45 min, which corresponds to an increase of 19% of untreated wheat straw. The results of a multiple linear regression model show that the solubilization of organic materials is influenced by temperature and time. Furthermore, using two different first-order kinetic models, an enhancement of AD rate during hydrolysis due to pretreatment is observed. However, the increasing intensity of pretreatment conditions is accompanied by a decreasing trend in the conversion of intermediates to methane.","Zerback, T; Schumacher, B; Weinrich, S; Hulsemann, B; Nelles, M",anaerobic digestion; wheat straw; hydrothermal pretreatment; biomethane potential; batch test,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr10061048,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,lignocellulose,wheat,straw,,,,,,,,
Combined ultrasonic-hydrothermal pretreatment to improve the biomethane potential of hazelnut shell,"This work evaluated for the first time the employment of hydrothermal alone (i.e. at 60, 80 and 100 degrees C) and combined ultrasonic-hydrothermal pretreatments on hazelnut shell (HS) to promote the energetic valorization of HS through anaerobic digestion. The highest cumulative biomethane yield of 137 mL CH4 center dot g VS-1 was achieved performing biochemical methane potential tests under wet-mesophilic conditions with the hydrothermally (i.e. at 100 degrees C) and ultrasonically-pretreated HS. This CH4 yield was 2.3-fold higher than that obtained with the raw HS due to an enhanced hemicellulose polymerization and delignification after the sequential hydrothermal and ultrasonic pretreatment. Under the same pretreatment conditions, total volatile fatty acids peaked at 755 mg HAc L-1. The biomethane production followed the modified Gompertz model (R2 = 0.993-0.996) and a Pearson correlation test showed that it was mainly influenced by the soluble chemical oxygen demand (i.e. 0.983).

Enhanced lignocellulosic component removal and biomethane potential from chestnut shell by a combined hydrothermal-alkaline pretreatment,"This study proposes new perspectives for the management and biorefinery of wastes deriving from the agri-food sector such as chestnut shell (CS), which was here used as an organic feedstock for biomethane production through anaerobic digestion (AD). 1-5% alkaline (i.e. NaOH and KOH), hydrothermal (i.e. at 100 degrees C) and combined hydrothermal-alkaline pretreatments were employed to enhance the CS biodegradability prior to biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests conducted under mesophilic conditions. The hydrothermally-pretreated CS with 3%NaOH achieved the highest biomethane yield of 253 (+/- 9) mL CH4.g VS-1 coupled to a volatile solid reduction of 48%. The hydrothermal-alkaline pretreatment positively affected both delignification and hemicellulose polymerization, promoting an approximately 2.4-fold higher substrate biodegradability compared to the untreated CS, which only reached a CH4 production of 104 (+/- 5) mL CH4.g VS-1.

Optimization of Sodium Hydroxide Pretreatment Conditions to Improve Biogas Production from Asparagus Stover,"Alkaline pretreatment was employed to enhance biogas production from asparagus stover with anaerobic digester in laboratory scale batch fermentation. Different pretreatment times (10, 18, 25 days), NaOH concentrations (2.5, 5, 7.5%), and water dose (20, 60, 100 mL) were tested to select the best pretreatment conditions. With response surface method (RSM) applied, the optimum pretreatment conditions were pretreatment time of 19d, NaOH concentration of 4.2%, water dose of 74 g. The biogas yield was predicted as 275.65 mL/g VS, while it was observed as 277.86 mL/g VS in the verification test, with the relative error of 0.80%. Further more, the verification tests show that contents of hemi-cellulose, cellulose and lignin after pretreatment were decreased by 65.20, 29.06 and 13.51%, respectively. The above results suggest that the effects of NaOH on degradations of hemi-cellulose and cellulose are higher than that on lignin.","Sun, C; Liu, RH; Cao, WX; Li, K; Wu, LJ",Alkaline pretreatment; Agricultural waste; Anaerobic digestion; Response surface method,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-017-0020-0,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,lignocellulose,asparagus,stover,88,80,75,3,,33,18,11
Enhanced the energy outcomes from microalgal biomass by the novel biopretreatment,"Microalgae have been considered as one of the most promising biomass for the generation of bio-fuels. The anaerobic digestion (AD) has been proved to be a promising technique to transfer the microalgal biomass into biofuels. Previous study demonstrated that anaerobic pretreatment of microalgae biomass by Bacillus licheniformis could improve methane production. In this study micro-aerobic bio-pretreatment of microalgal biomass by the facultative anaerobic bacteria Bacillus licheniformis was invested with different loads of oxygen supplied. The bio-hydrogen and biomethane productions were tested to calculate total energy outcomes. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) photographs suggested that the novel micro-aerobic bio-pretreatment (MBP) could effectively damage the firm cell wall of algal cells. The processing time of the novel method (24 h) was less than the previous anaerobic pretreatment (60 h).

Comparative study of different thermal pretreatment techniques for accelerated methane production from rice straw,"This study emphasizes the use of different thermal pretreatment methods (i.e., hot air oven, hot water bath, autoclave and microwave) on pretreatment of rice straw prior to anaerobic degradation. These pretreatment methods resulted in reasonably high solubilization of recalcitrant biomass. Maximum solublisation was attained by microwave (190 degrees C; exposure time-4 min) (66.6%) followed by autoclave, hot air oven and hot water bath methods. Accelerated cumulative methane yield of microwave pretreated sample achieved was 367.71 mL/g-VSadded, which was 160.68 mL/g-VS(added)higher than the control. Combining this high temperature conditions with lesser exposure time also improved the energy balance of the process. The physicochemical characteristics of pretreated rice straw were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), FESEM analysis showed the increased porosity of the rice straw, FTIR analysis showed the omission of hemicellulose from the matrix and with XRD analysis reduced value of crystallinity index supports the destruction of the crystalline matrix.","Kainthola, J; Shariq, M; Kalamdhad, AS; Goud, VV",Pretreatment; Rice straw; Anaerobic digestion; Methane yield; Lignocellulosic biomass,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13399-019-00537-8,Physical,thermal,"hot air oven, hot water bath, autoclave,microwave",lignocellulose,rice,straw,94,80,,,,,,

Improving biodegradability of corn stover pretreated by different organic acids: Investigation on the hydrolysis/acidification and methanogenic performance,"Lignocellulosic materials (LM) are abundant bioenergy resources for renewable energy development. Pretreatment using organic acids including acetic acid (HAc) and butyric acid (HBu) was applied to reduce the recalcitrance of LM in methane production by two-phase anaerobic digestion (AD). The structural and compositional changes of solids and aqueous phase were analyzed. It showed that pretreatment with 2 g/L HAc/HBu at 120 degrees C was optimum, under which the net volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production could reach the maximum concentration of 11.5 g/L. The yield of VFAs decreased with the concentration increasing to > 2 g/L due to the feedback inhibition on the microbial metabolism. The species of organic acids also influenced the metabolic pathway of VFAs. The acidogenic metabolites can be transformed in up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) with organic loading rate (OLR) up to 12 g COD/Ld (COD, chemical oxygen demand).

Effects of freezing-thawing pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of wheat straw and its kinetics analysis,"In this study, freezing-thawing (FT) pretreatment of different freezing time and freezing temperatures was investigated to find the effect on anaerobic digestion (AD) of wheat straw (WS). The freezing temperature gradient is - 10 degrees C, - 20 degrees C, - 40 degrees C and - 80 degrees C, and the freezing time gradient is 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 96 h. Total methane production exhibited a mere distance among all samples. Morphology change sculptured by SEM showed this method broke the structure of WS leaving fragments and pores in varying degrees. Three kinetic models were performed on WS to represent the behavior of experimental data. Kinetic model parameters of total methane production and lag phase time showed that logistic function model had the best fit, followed by modified Gompertz model, yet transfer function model lost efficacy in this experiment. Logistic function model was then used to reveal the influence on lag phase caused by freezing time and freezing temperature, and the results implied that FT pretreatment can shorten the lag phase time of AD, providing a 21.39% improvement under the optimal conditions of - 20 degrees C 96 h. The analysis of response surface regression shows that the freezing temperature has more effect on the lag phase time of anaerobic digestion than freezing time. Warmer freezing temperature of - 20 degrees C do better than - 80 degrees C on lag time, which can be achieved in most cold regions, so this treatment can occur naturally in such area without additional energy input.","Zhang, QR; Yao, YQ; Xi, XM",Freezing-Thawing pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Kinetic analysis; Wheat straw,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10098-021-02091-2,Physical,freezing,freeze-thaw,lignocellulose,wheat,straw,97,85,38,0.91,41.7582417582418,31,21,27
A solar-driven continuous hydrothermal pretreatment system for biomethane production from microalgae biomass,"Hydrothermal pretreatment is an efficient approach to enhance methane production from microalgae biomass by anaerobic digestion. However, the high energy consumption hinders the development of hydrothermal pretreatment. In this study, a solar-driven hydrothermal pretreatment system was proposed to save energy in hydrothermal pretreatment. In this system, microalgae slurry directly flows through the parabolic trough collector and is hydrolyzed while absorbing solar energy. The effects of operation parameters (i.e., direct normal irradiation, flow rate, mass fraction, and retention time) on the yield of organic matter were also investigated. The maximum yield of carbohydrates (267.3 mg/g total solid) and proteins (265.2 mg/g total solid) from pretreated microalgae biomass was 7.4 and 3.7 times that obtained from the raw microalgae slurry, respectively. In addition, the methane produced from the microalgae biomass pretreated by the solar-driven hydrothermal pretreatment system increased by 57% in anaerobic digestion, compared to that obtained using raw microalgae biomass as a substrate. The solar-driven hydrothermal pretreatment system can be used as an alternative energy saving approach for the hydrothermal pretreatment of microalgae slurry.","Xiao, C; Liao, Q; Fu, Q; Huang, Y; Chen, H; Zhang, H; Xia, A; Zhu, X; Reungsang, A; Liu, ZD",Microalgae biomass; Anaerobic digestion; Parabolic trough collector; Hydrothermal pretreatment,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.12.014,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,micro-algae,chlorella,,96,89,,,,,,
Anaerobic conversion of Chromolaena odorata (Siam weed) to biogas,"This study evaluated the anaerobic mono-digestion of two different samples of Chromolaena odorata. Combinations of mechanical and thermo-alkaline pretreatments were applied to one of the two samples and labeled as X'' while the second had no thermo-alkaline treatment and was labeled as Y''. The Central Composite Design was used to design the pretreatments. The physicochemical characteristics of the substrates were carried out using standard methods after appropriate pretreatments. From the experimental set-ups, the most probable actual biogas yields in experiments X'' and Y'' were 0.3554 m(3)/kg Total Solid (TS) fed and 0.1803 m(3)/kg TSfed with the desirability of 99 and 100%, respectively. Further shown in the result is a 49.2% higher experimental (actual) biogas yield in experiment X'' over Y''. Gas chromatographic analysis revealed the CH4 and CO2 content of both experiments to be 65 +/- 1.5%; 21 +/- 3% and 53.5 +/- 2.5%; 26 +/- 3%, respectively.

Effect of Freshwater Washing Pretreatment on Sargassum muticum as a Feedstock for Biogas Production,"The pretreatment of seaweed by washing in freshwater is often used in seaweed biofuel research studies. However, the effect of washing seaweed prior to anaerobic digestion (AD) does not appear to have been greatly studied. This study examines washing Sargassum muticum with freshwater and its effect on ultimate and proximate analyses, salt content, methane production from anaerobic digestion, and leachate loss from ensiling. Washing with freshwater significantly (p < 0.01) increased moisture content (unwashed 85.6%, washed 89.1%) but significantly (p < 0.05) reduced ash (unwashed 32.7% dry weight dw, washed 30.6% dw) and salt content (unwashed ash containing 51.5%, washed 42.5%). The dry biomass higher heating value was significantly (p < 0.05) increased by washing due to the lower ash content (11.5 to 12.6 kJ g(-1) dw). There was no significant change in the protein or lipid content, although washing increased the nitrogen content (3.85-4.77% dw). Washing significantly (p < 0.05) increased leachate losses during ensiling, with total leachate losses increasing after washing (12.7-25.2%). The methane yield from anaerobic digestion (28 days) was not statistically significantly different (p > 0.05) between unwashed (0.225 L CH4 g(-1) VS) and washed samples (0.177 L CH4 g(-1) VS). However, washing delayed biomethane production.","Milledge, JJ; Nielsen, BV; Sadek, MS; Harvey, PJ",Sargassum muticum; washing; anaerobic digestion; seaweed; pretreatment; ensiling; macroalgae,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en11071771,Process improvement,washing,,algae,sargassum,,,,27,4,,,,
Pretreatment of municipal waste activated sludge for volatile sulfur compounds control in anaerobic digestion,"The effect of combination of mechanical and chemical pretreatment of municipal waste activated sludge (WAS) prior to anaerobic digestion was studied using a laboratory scale system with an objective to decrease volatile sulfur compounds in biogas and digested sludge. Mechanical pretreatment was conducted using depressurization of WAS through a valve from a batch pretreatment reactor pressurized at 75 +/- 1 psi, while combined pretreatments were conducted using six different dosages of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ferrous chloride (FeCl2) along with mechanical pretreatment. About 37-46% removal of H2S in biogas occurred for different combined pretreatment conditions. Sludge solubilization achieved due to the mechanical pretreatment increased total cumulative methane production by 8-10% after 30 days during the biochemical methane potential (BMP) test. The pretreatment also improved dewaterability in terms of time to filter (TTF), and decreased methyl mercaptan generation potential of the digested sludge.

Pretreatment technology for the beneficial biological reuse of municipal sewage sludges,"Modern municipal sewage waste treatment plants use conventional mechanical and biological processes to reclaim waste waters. This process has the overall effect of converting a water pollution problem into a solid waste disposal problem (sludges). The costs for conventional disposal of Sewage sludges have risen dramatically because of increased environmental mandates, which restrict their disposal, as well as a dwindling number of landfills. Previously, we determined that secondary bioprocessing (specifically anaerobic digestion) was not effective in reducing the organic content and bulk of the sludge waste (1). Therefore, we have examined the potential of a variety of pretreatment technologies designed to disrupt the macrostructure of the sludge and thereby enhance its subsequent biodegradation. Two thermal/mechanical pretreatments tested were found to have a dramatic effect on the subsequent bioconversion of the microbial sludges. Both technologies evaluated, sonication and shear, were found to be affected by sludge solids levels, duration of treatment, and treatment temperature. Optimum sonication pretreatment occurred with sludge solids of 1% and treatment times of 4-8 min. The most effectivee treatment temperature tested was 55 degrees C. The optimum enhancement in bioconversion potential for the sonication pretreatment was 80-83% of the materials carbon oxygen demand (COD) content. The optimum shear pretreatment occurred with sludge solids of 1-2% and treatment times of 6-10 min. The most effective treatment temperature tested was 87 degrees C.

Pretreatment of Lignocellulosic Biomass with 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium Acetate for Its Eventual Valorization by Anaerobic Digestion,"This study assessed the breakdown of lignocellulosic biomass (LB) with the ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([Emim][Ac]) as a pretreatment to increase the methane yield. The pretreatment was conducted for wheat straw (WS), barley straw (BS), and grape stem (GS) at 120 degrees C for 120 min, using several LB to [Emim][Ac] ratios (1:1, 1:3, and 1:5 w/w). Pretreatment significantly disrupted the lignocellulose matrix of each biomass into soluble sugars. GS showed the highest sugar yield, which was followed by WS, while BS was slightly hydrolyzed (175.3 +/- 2.3, 158.2 +/- 5.2, and 51.1 +/- 3.1 mg glucose g(-1) biomass, respectively). Likewise, the pretreatment significantly reduced the cellulose crystallinity index (CrI) of the resulting solid fractions of GS and WS by 15% and 9%, respectively, but slightly affected the CrI of BS (5%). Thus, BMP tests were only carried out for raw and hydrothermally and [Emim][Ac] (1:5) pretreated GS and WS.

Dairy Manure Digestate Age Increases Ultrasound Disintegration Efficiency at Low Specific Energies,"Substantial insight into the effect of ultrasound disintegration on the changes in biochemical parameters of manure digestate and digestate age is needed to understand the potential of digestate treatment. To address this knowledge gap, in this study, the effect of digestate age on the efficiency of ultrasound (US) disintegration was investigated. In this scope, dairy manure digestate samples were incubated in an oven at 37 degrees C for a predetermined amount of time to obtain simulated digestate ages of 15, 22, 29, 36 and 43 days. The results showed that US disintegration efficiency significantly affected the initial biochemical characteristics of digestate and that the digestate age had a significant effect on the US disintegration efficiency. This effect diminished when the applied specific energy (SE) was higher than 3000 kJ/kg total solids (TS). A numerical partial least squares (PLS) model was constructed to investigate the relative influences of the initial biochemical parameters on the soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) and soluble carbohydrates (sCARB) solubilization. The results of the high-quality (R-2 = 0.8) model indicated that the most influential parameters for the efficiency of US disintegration were the SE, the initial sCARB(0), the TS, the initial sCOD(0) and the volatile solids (VS).","Somers, MH; Azman, S; Vanhecke, R; Appels, L",digestate; anaerobic digestion; pretreatment; digestate disintegration; manure; PLS modeling,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14061640,Physical,ultrasonic,,manure,cow,,,,,,,,,
Effect of Combined Microwave-Ultrasonic Pretreatment of Real Mixed Sludge on the Enhancement of Anaerobic Digester Performance,"The anaerobic biodegradability of combined microwave-ultrasonic pretreated thickened excess activated sludge (PTEAS) mixed with raw primary sludge (PS) was investigated in this study. The pretreatment resulted in the enhancement of mesophilic anaerobic digester performance which in turn improved biogas production capacity and quality, total and volatile solid reduction, dewaterability, protein solubilisation and significant reduction of pathogens to produce class A biosolid. This study presented the results of two continuously stirred mesophilic anaerobic digesters charged with various proportions of a mixture of PTEAS and PS similar to the large-scale industrial practice. Digester 1 was charged with 75 % PTEAS and 25 % PS, while digester 2 was fed with 25 % PTEAS and 75 % PS. The methane production was 122 mL CH4/g total chemical oxygen demand for digester 2 after 20 days of anaerobic digestion. This amount further increased for both digesters with digestion time. The biogas quality in terms of methane to carbondioxide ratio (CH4/CO2) was significantly improved for digester 1 compared with digester 2 after 20 days of digestion. Volatile solid reduction of 76 and 57 % was achieved for digester 1 and digester 2 respectively after the same 20 days of digestion. The CH4/CO2 ratio reached 2.2:1 and 1.1:1 after 20 days of digestion for digester 1 and digester 2, respectively. Higher percentage of PTEAS increases the digestion kinetics, the methane production capacity and the biogas quality. Furthermore, total coliform reduction of 84 and 44 % was achieved for digester 1 and digester 2 respectively after 22 days of digestion.

Enhancement of anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge by alkaline solubilization,"The performance of an anaerobic digestion fed with waste activated sludge (WAS) pretreated with NaOH was examined The sludge was periodically collected from a municipal wastewater-treatment plant. The laboratory work was run in four I-I semi-continuous anaerobic digestion reactors. Reactor-A was fed with untreated WAS at 1% total solids (TS). The other three reactors, B, C and D, were respectively fed with WAS (1% TS) pretreated with 20 meq/l NaOH, WAS (1% TS) pretreated with 40 meq/l NaOH, and WAS (2% TS) pretreated with 20 meq/l NaOH. The reactors were operated at 35 degrees C at four hydraulic retention rimes - 20, 13, 10 and 7.5 days. The performances of reactors B, C and D, in terms of chemical oxygen demand (GOD), volatile solids (VS) removal, and gas production, were superior to that of reactor A. At a retention time of 10 days, the COD removals of reactors A, B, C and D were 38, 46, 51 and 52%, respectively. The gas productions of reactors B, C and D were, respectively, increased by 33, 30 and 163% over that of reactor A. The sludge dewaterability was examined by capillary suction rime (CST). The dewaterability of digested sludge was improved in reactors B, C and D. Capillary suction of digested sludges gave times in the range 148-389 s, compared with 309-735 s for undigested sludges.

Role of H2O2 dosage on methane production from tannery wastewater: experimental and kinetic study,"A pretreatment with H2O2 was conducted to improve the performance of the anaerobic digestion (AD) process for a partial treatment of tannery wastewater (TWW). Four different H2O2 dosages (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 g/L) were tested by adding to TWW different volumes of a 30% (m/v) H2O2 solution in order to improve the biodegradability of TWW organic load and decrease the total Cr concentration. Indeed, a less total Cr concentration was detected in pretreated samples that showed a minimum removal efficiency of 11% and a maximum removal efficiency of 41%. Moreover, several Biomethane Potential tests (BMP) were conducted to assess the enhanced biodegradability of pretreated TWW. Methane yields resulted in 594, 1151, 1090, 767, and 525 mL CH4/g TVS for the unpretrated TWW and for those pretreated with 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 g/L of H2O2, respectively. BMP tests proved that the best pretreatment condition for TWW, in terms of methane production and consequently total COD reduction, was achieved with a low dosage of H2O2 (0.5 g H2O2/L), corresponding to 1.0.10-4 g H2O2/g TVS and 3.2.10-5 g H2O2/g COD, whereas the highest dosage (4 g H2O2/L) was not related to the highest methane yield. Such contradictory results highlights the relevance of an appropriate dosage of H2O2, Finally, a kinetic study was also conducted.","Achouri, O; Panico, A; Bencheikh-Lehocine, M; Derbal, K; Arias, D; Iasimone, F; Padulano, R; Bouteraa, M; Rebahi, A; Pirozzi, F",Tannery wastewater; Anaerobic digestion; H2O2 pretreatment; Residual H2O2 inhibition,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jwpe.2021.102313,Chemical,oxidizer,peroxide h2o2,industrial wastewater,tannery,,9.6,5.1,,,,,,
Effect of coupling alkaline pretreatment and sewage sludge co-digestion on methane production and fertilizer potential of digestate,"This study aims at investigating how organic waste co-digestion coupled with alkaline pretreatment can impact the methane production and agronomic value of produced digestates. For this purpose, sludge alone and mixed with olive pomace or macroalgal residues were subjected to anaerobic digestion with and without alkaline pretreatment. In addition, co-digestion of pretreated sludge with raw substrates was also carried out and compared to the whole mixture pretreatment. KOH pretreatment enhanced methane production by 39%, 15% and 49% from sludge, sludge mixed with olive pomace and sludge mixed with macroalgal residues, respectively. The digestates were characterised according to their physico-chemical and agronomic properties. They were then applied as biofertilizers for tomato growth during the first vegetative stage (28 days of culture). Concentrations in chlorophyll a and carotenoids in tomato plants, following sludge digestate addition, rose by 46% and 41% respectively. Sludge digestate enhanced tomato plant dry weight by 87%, while its nitrogen content increased by 90%. The impact of nitrogen and phosphorus contents in the digestate was strongest on tomato plant dry weight, thus explaining the efficiency of sludge digestate relative to other types of digestate. However, when methane production is considered, the combination of pretreatment with co-digestion of macroalgal residues and sludge appears most beneficial for maximizing energy recovery and for biofertilizer generation.

Influence of Aerobic Pretreatment of Poultry Manure on the Biogas Production Process,"Anaerobic digestion of poultry manure is a potentially-sustainable means of stabilizing this waste while generating biogas. However, technical, and environmental protection challenges remain, including high concentrations of ammonia, low C/N ratios, limited digestibility of bedding, and questions about transformation of nutrients during digestion. This study evaluated the effect of primary biological treatment of poultry manure on the biogas production process and reduction of ammonia emissions. Biogas yield from organic matter content in the aerobic pretreatment groups was 13.96% higher than that of the control group. Biogas production analysis showed that aerobic pretreatment of poultry manure has a positive effect on biogas composition; methane concentration increases by 6.94-7.97% after pretreatment. In comparison with the control group, NH3 emissions after aerobic pretreatment decreased from 3.37% (aerobic pretreatment without biological additives) to 33.89% (aerobic pretreatment with biological additives), depending on treatment method.","Rubezius, M; Venslauskas, K; Navickas, K; Bleizgys, R",anaerobic digestion; ammonia mitigation; aerobic pretreatment; poultry manure management,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr8091109,Biological,aerobic,,manure,poultry,,15,13,7.3,0.85,9,,,
Improving physicochemical characteristics and anaerobic digestion performance of rice straw via ammonia pretreatment at varying concentrations and moisture levels,"Rice straw physicochemical characteristics and anaerobic digestion (AD) performance via ammonia pretreatment at varying ammonia concentrations (2%, 4%, and 6%) and moisture contents (30%, 50%, 70%, and 90%) under a mild condition were investigated. The results showed that the ammonia pretreatment effectively damaged the rice straw structure, increased the soluble organic concentration, and improved rice straw hydrolysis and AD performance. After pretreatment, the ester bond and ether bond were ruptured in lignocellulose and the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were within the range of 1457.81-1823.67 mg.L-1. In addition, ammonia pretreatment had high selectivity on lignin removal, resulting in a maximum lignin removal rate of 50.80%. The highest methane yield of rice straw was 250.34 ml.(g VS)(-1) ata 4% ammonia concentration coupled with a 70% moisture content, which was 28.55% higher than that of the control.The result showed that ammonia pretreatment of rice straw is technically suitable to enhance AD performance for further application.

Enhanced methane production from microalgal biomass by anaerobic bio-pretreatment,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) of microalgal biomass is one of the most energy efficient technologies to convert microalgae to biofuels. In order to improve the biogas productivity, breaking up the tough and rigid cell wall of microalgae by pretreatment is necessary. In this work, Bacillus licheniformis, a facultative anaerobic bacterial with hydrolytic and acidogenic activities, was adopted to pretreat Chlorella sp. In the established pretreatment process, pure bacterial culture (0%, 1%, 2%, 4%, 8%, v/v) were used to pretreat Chlorella sp. under anaerobic condition at 37 degrees C for 60 h. The soluble chemical oxygen demands (SCOD) content was increased by 16.4-43.4%, while volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were improved by 17.3-44.2%. Furthermore, enhancement of methane production (9.2-22.7%) was also observed in subsequent AD. The results indicated that the more dosages of bacteria were used to pretreat the microalgal biomass in the range of 1-8%, the more methane was produced. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Below and above boiling point comparison of microwave irradiation and conductive heating for municipal sludge digestion under identical heating/cooling profiles,"This research provides a comprehensive comparison between microwave (MW) and conductive heating (CH) sludge pretreatments under identical heating/cooling profiles at below and above boiling point temperatures. Previous comparison studies were constrained to an uncontrolled or a single heating rate due to lack of a CH equipment simulating MW under identical thermal profiles. In this research, a novel custom-built pressure-sealed vessel which could simulate MW pretreatment under identical heating/cooling profiles was used for CH pretreatment. No statistically significant difference was proven between MW and CH pretreatments in terms of sludge solubilization, anaerobic biogas yield and organics biodegradation rate (p-value > 0.05), while statistically significant effects of temperature and heating rate were observed (p-value < 0.05). These results explain the contradictory results of previous studies in which only the final temperature (not heating/cooling rates) was controlled. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of hydrothermal pretreatment of sugar beet pulp for methane production,The effect of Liquid Hot Water treatment conditions on the degree of sugar beet pulp (SBP) degradation was studied. The SBP was subjected to hydrothermal processing at temperatures ranging from 120 to 200 degrees C. The relationship between processing temperature and parameters of liquid and solid fractions of resulting hydrolysates as well as the efficiency of their methane fermentation was determined. The highest concentration of free glucose (3.29 mg ml (1)) was observed when the hydrolysis was conducted at 160 degrees C (it was 4-fold higher than that after processing at 120 degrees C). Total acids and aldehydes concentrations in the liquid fractions were increased from 0.005 mg ml (1) for the untreated SBP to 1.61 mg ml (1) after its processing at 200 degrees C. Parameters of the hydrolysates obtained by the LHW treatment decided of the efficiency of methane fermentation. The highest cumulative methane yield (502.50 L CH4 kg (1) VS) was obtained from the sugar beet pulp hydrolysate produced at 160 degrees C.

Effects on mesophilic anaerobic digestion performance of corn stalk with the addition/pretreatment of depolymerization wastewater,"To develop the economic anaerobic digestion (AD) pretreatment technology, the digestive performance of corn stalk (CS) with the addition/pretreatment of depolymerization wastewater (DW) was evaluated. In this study, CS was pretreated by DW for 0 day (Only added) or 3 days, namely T0 and T1, respectively, and a mesophilic AD was performed with the whole slurry (CS and DW). Results showed that the addition of DW introduced digestive substrates, i.e. acetic acid, into the system, which promoted the hydrolysis of CS. The addition/pretreatment of DW changed the reducing sugar content (RS), pH and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) content, and then increased cumulative methane production. The maximum cumulative methane production was achieved in T1 (160.77 mL/g VS), followed by T0 (152.87 mL/g VS) and control group (CK, 138.29 mL/g VS). Microbial community analysis indicated this phenomenon was caused by the increasing activity of the hydrolytic bacteria. The addition of DW slightly facilitated the hydrolytic and acidogenic stage, and the pretreatment further facilitated this stage. This study proposed a new pretreatment for AD, which paved a way for the utilization of DW.","Wang, Z; Sun, Y; Qu, JB; Yang, FL; Li, J; Yan, BB",Anaerobic digestion; Depolymerization wastewater; Corn stalk; Pretreatment; Microbial diversity,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2022.124234,Chemical,acidic,depolymerization wastewater,lignocellulose,corn,stalk,92,86,43,0.46,29,,,
Conductive heating and microwave hydrolysis under identical heating profiles for advanced anaerobic digestion of municipal sludge,"Microwave (2.45 GHz, 1200 W) and conventional heating (custom pressure vessel) pretreatments were applied to dewatered municipal waste sludge (18% total solids) using identical heating profiles that span a wide range of temperatures (80-160 degrees C) Fourteen lab-scale semi-continuous digesters were set up to optimize the energy (methane) output and sludge retention time (SRT) requirements of untreated (control) and thermally pretreated anaerobic digesters operated under mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures. Both pretreatment methods indicated that in the pretreatment range of 80-160 degrees C, temperature was a statistically significant factor ( p-value < 0.05) for increasing solubilization of chemical oxygen demand and biopolymers (proteins, sugars, humic acids) of the waste sludge. However, the type of pretreatment method, i.e. microwave versus conventional heating, had no statistically significant effect ( p-value >0.05) on sludge solubilization. With the exception of the control digesters at a 5-d SRT, all control and pretreated digesters achieved steady state at all three SRTs, corresponding to volumetric organic loading rates of 1.74-6.96 g chemical oxygen demand/L/d. At an SRT of 5 d, both mesophilic and then mophilic controls stopped producing biogas after 20 d of operation with total volatile fatty acids concentrations exceeding 1818 mg/L at pH <5.64 for mesophilic and 2853 mg/L at pH <7.02 for thermophilic controls, while the pretreated digesters continued producing biogas. Furthermore, relative (to control) organic removal efficiencies dramatically increased as SRT was shortened from 20 to 10 and then 5 d, indicating that the control digesters were challenged as the organic loading rate was increased. Energy analysis showed that, at an elevated temperature of 160 degrees C, the amount of methane recovered was not enough to compensate for the energy input. Among the digesters with positive net energy productions, control and pretreated digesters at 80 degrees C were more favorable at an SRT of 10 d. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Semi-continuous anaerobic digestion of extruded OFMSW: Process performance and energetics evaluation,"Recently, extrusion press treatment shows some promising advantages for effectively separating of organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) from the mixed MSW, which is critical for their following high-efficiency treatment. In this study, an extruded OFMSW obtained from a demonstrated MSW treatment plant was characterized, and submitted to a series of semi-continuous anaerobic experiments to examine its biodegradability and process stability. The results indicated that the extruded OFMSW was a desirable substrate with a high biochemical methane potential (BMP), balanced nutrients and reliable stability. For increasing organic loading rates (OLRs), feeding higher volatile solid (VS) contents in feedstock was much better than shortening the hydraulic retention times (HRTs), while excessively high contents caused a low biodegradability due to the mass transfer limitation. For energetics evaluation, a high electricity output of 129.19-156.37 kWh/ton raw MSW was obtained, which was further improved by co-digestion with food waste.","Mu, L; Zhang, L; Zhu, KY; Ma, J; Li, AM",Extrusion pretreatment; OFMSW; Food waste; Trace metal; Anaerobic digestion,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.09.085,Physical,mechanical desintegration,extrusion,ofmsw,municipal solid waste,,,,,,,,,
Increased solubilization of excess sludge does not always result in enhanced anaerobic digestion efficiency,"Solubilization (SCOD/TCOD, chemical oxygen demand (COD), %) is generally used as an indicator for the pretreatment effectiveness in anaerobic digestion (AD) of excess sludge. In the present work, ultrasonic (irradiation 5-60 mm) and alkaline pretreatments (pH 9-13) were applied to excess sludge individually and in combination. Biological methane potential tests were carried out using the whole part of pre-treated sludge and only the soluble fraction. Although solubilization increased with pretreatment intensity increase, methane production was inconsistent with increased solubilization, due to the lower methane yield of soluble fraction. While the soluble fraction obtained under mild pretreatment condition (pH 9 + ultrasonication 5 min) showed 91% of methane yield, it was only 61% in case of severe pretreatment condition (pH 13 + ultrasonication 60 mm). 25.8% of the pretreated sludge at (pH 13 + ultrasonication 60 min) consisted of soluble but non-biodegradable portion.

Methods for the Evaluation of Industrial Mechanical Pretreatments before Anaerobic Digesters,"Different methods were tested to evaluate the performance of a pretreatment before anaerobic digestion. Besides conventional biochemical parameters, such as the biochemical methane potential (BMP), the methane production rate, or the extent of solubilization of organic compounds, methods for physical characterization were also developed in the present work. Criteria, such as the particle size distribution, the water retention capacity, and the rheological properties, were thus measured. These methods were tested on samples taken in two full-scale digesters operating with cattle manure as a substrate and using hammer mills. The comparison of samples taken before and after the pretreatment unit showed no significant improvement in the methane potential. However, the methane production rate increased by 15% and 26% for the two hammer mills, respectively. A relevant improvement of the rheological properties was also observed. This feature is likely correlated with the average reduction in particle size during the pretreatment operation, but these results needs confirmation in a wider range of systems.","Fernandez, HC; Ramirez, DA; Franco, RT; Buffiere, P; Bayard, R",anaerobic digestion; mechanical pretreatments; agricultural wastes; rheology; physical properties,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules25040860,Physical,mechanical desintegration,milling hammer,manure,cow,,,,,,,,,

Microwave Effects on Soluble Substrate and Thermophilic Digestibility of Activated Sludge,"Thickened waste-activated sludge (TWAS) was subjected to microwave pretreatment and athermal irradiation. The soluble phase of each type of TWAS pretreatment was subject to ultrafiltration in series using progressively smaller pore-size membranes (300, 100, 10, and 1 kDa) and biodegradability tests. Microwave pretreatment solubilizes a considerable amount of the suspended organic substrate, but athermal irradiation also causes solubilization of organic matter, although at a smaller scale than microwave. Proteins are particularly sensitive to athermal irradiation, and both microwave and athermal irradiation are capable of changing the size distribution of dissolved organic matter. Athermal irradiation and microwave have a substantially different effect on thermophilic anaerobic biodegradability of the various size fractions obtained after ultrafiltration. Slight inhibition and decrease in total biogas production was measured in some microwave tests. Athermal irradiation does not cause a decrease in maximum biogas production rate in any test and increases slightly biogas production.","Coelho, NMG; Droste, RL; Kennedy, KJ",microwave; athermal; anaerobic digestion; sludge pretreatment; solubilization; fractionation; digestibility,2014,http://dx.doi.org/10.2175/106143013X13736496909635,Physical,thermal,"microwave,""""",activated sludge,Thickened waste-activated sludge,,4.3,2.9,,,,,,
Physio-chemical pretreatments for improved methane potential of Miscanthus lutarioriparius,"Bio-energy production from lignocelluloses biomass has gained a lot of interest in recent years. Miscanthus sp. are high lignocelluloses biomass yielding with relatively high carbohydrate content cultivable on different soils and under climatic conditions. However, the lignocellulosic nature means that cellulose and hemicellulose are cover by lignin network that might limit hydrolysis. In this study, physical pretreatments (size reduction), physiochemical (steam expulsion) and chemical pre-treatments (mild acid and alkaline) were investigated in a view to improve the anaerobic biodegradability of Miscanthus lutarioriparius for biogas production. Prior to the pretreatment and methane potential test, the compositional analyses of M. lutarioriparius was performed in order unveil the carbohydrate (cellulose and hemicelluloses), protein and lignin contents. From these analyses, the maximum theoretical methane potential was estimated. All pretreatments led to solubilisation of organic matter as was evidenced by increase dissolve COD and ammonium nitrogen. There was a positive correlation between dissolved COD and methane yields meanwhile a negative correlation was observed for reducing sugar and methane yields. The achieved methane yields ranged from 121 to 238 ml CH4/g VS. Steam explosion, 0.3 M NaOH treatment and 0.5 mm size reduction led to the highest increases in methane yields, which was in the order of 57% with regard to the untreated samples. These improvements resulted in 71% of theoretical methane yield of M. lutarioriparius. Alkaline pretreatment in particular also improve the rate of methane production as was evidenced by the fact that as high 15% of the final methane yield that was achieve on the first day as compared to only 3% for the untreated sample. Indeed, the time to reach 90% of the ultimate methane yield was reduced by 13 days following 0.3 M NaOH treatment.

Physio-chemical pretreatments for improved methane potential of Miscanthus lutarioriparius,"Bio-energy production from lignocelluloses biomass has gained a lot of interest in recent years. Miscanthus sp. are high lignocelluloses biomass yielding with relatively high carbohydrate content cultivable on different soils and under climatic conditions. However, the lignocellulosic nature means that cellulose and hemicellulose are cover by lignin network that might limit hydrolysis. In this study, physical pretreatments (size reduction), physiochemical (steam expulsion) and chemical pre-treatments (mild acid and alkaline) were investigated in a view to improve the anaerobic biodegradability of Miscanthus lutarioriparius for biogas production. Prior to the pretreatment and methane potential test, the compositional analyses of M. lutarioriparius was performed in order unveil the carbohydrate (cellulose and hemicelluloses), protein and lignin contents. From these analyses, the maximum theoretical methane potential was estimated. All pretreatments led to solubilisation of organic matter as was evidenced by increase dissolve COD and ammonium nitrogen.

Towards green whiskey production: Anaerobic digestion of distillery by-products and the effects of pretreatment,"Using renewable biogas from the anaerobic digestion of distillery by-products as a low-carbon heat source can decarbonize the distillery process and support the distillery industry to transition to a more sustainable production process. This study investigated the anaerobic digestion performance of different types of whiskey byproducts and the effects of acid pretreatment on the digestion of solid by-products. Results of biomethane potential assays showed that the methane yield from the unprocessed by-products was 330 mL/g volatile solids (VS) from draff, 495 mL/g VS from thin stillage, and 503 mL/g VS from thick stillage. For the processed by-products the specific methane yield was 370 mL/g VS from cake maize, 382 mL/g VS from wet distillers' grains with solubles (WDGS), and 545 mL/g VS from syrup. Acid pretreatment (1% H2SO4 at 135 C for 15 min) did not significantly improve the methane yield from solid by-products (such as draff and WDGS) but reduced the digestion time by 54.5% for cake maize. The microbial community analysis revealed that methane production from the untreated and acid-pretreated solid by-products (draff and WDGS) was mainly through the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway. The gross thermal energy in the form of methane produced from 100 tonnes of mixed unprocessed by-products (draff, thin stillage, and thick stillage) was calculated as 24.4 MW(th)h equivalent to 60.6% of the thermal energy consumed in whiskey production, which effected the same percentage of CO2 emissions reduction.","Kang, XH; Lin, RC; Wu, BT; Li, LH; Deng, C; Rajendran, K; Sun, YM; O'Shea, R; Murphy, JD",Whiskey by-products; Anaerobic digestion; Pretreatment; Microbial community; Decarbonization,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.131844,Chemical,acidic,,lignocellulose,spent grains,spent grains,,,,,,,,
Enhancing volatile fatty acid (VFA) and bio-methane production from lawn grass with pretreatment,"The bioconversion of fiber-based carbohydrates during anaerobic digestion (AD) is impeded due to the recalcitrant nature of the plant cell wall. Pretreatment of lignocellulose materials under mild conditions are needed to improve the digestibility at minimum cost. This study investigated the effects of different pretreatments, including ozone, soaking aqueous ammonia (SAA), combined ozone and SAA (OSAA), and size reduction to enhance volatile fatty acid (VFA) and bio-methane production when lawn grass was used as substrate. To study VFA production, methanogenesis was selectively inhibited by sodium 2-bromoethanesulfonate to decouple the relation between VFA and bio-methane. The enzymatic hydrolysis of SAA (residence time 24 h at 50 degrees C) and OSAA (10 min ozonation and 6 h of SAA) in pretreatment of lawn grass sample resulted in 86.71% and 89.63% sugar recovery, respectively.

Pretreatment of vinegar residue and anaerobic sludge for enhanced hydrogen and methane production in the two-stage anaerobic system,"To enhance the conversion of vinegar residue to bio-energy gas, pretreatment of vinegar residue and anaerobic sludge were investigated in a two-stage anaerobic system. SEM and XRD were applied to observe the variation of cellulosic materials in vinegar residue. Alkaline and acid pretreatments were applied. The alkaline pretreatment of anaerobic sludge was an effective approach for hydrogenogen enrichment. Compared with oxalic acid, hydrochloric acid released more organic substrates. Analysis of SEM and XRD illustrated that the amorphous cellulosic structure of vinegar residue was significantly disintegrated by acid. The higher hydrogen yield, the shorter lag phase and digestion time indicated that the performance of anaerobic digestion was enhanced by pretreatment of vinegar residue and anaerobic sludge. The fracture of cellulosic materials and the higher concentration of reducing sugar explained the higher efficiency of the two-stage anaerobic digestion.

Unveiling the mechanisms of a novel polyoxometalates (POMs)-based pretreatment technology for enhancing methane production from waste activated sludge,"This study proposed a novel polyoxometalates (POMs)-based pretreatment technology to improve methane production from waste activated sludge (WAS) for the first time. Experimental results indicated methane production from WAS pretreated with 0.25 g POMs/g TSS increased by 43.7%. Mechanism analysis revealed POMs pretreatment promoted WAS disintegration and improved the biodegradability of the released organics. The declined oxidation-reduction potential of digestion system provided a more favorable situation for anaerobes, and hence had positive impacts on the activity of enzymes associated with hydrolysis/acidification/methanogenesis. Model-based analysis elucidated POMs pretreatment remarkably increased both biochemical methane potential and hydrolysis rate. Microbial community analysis showed microbial community was shifted toward increase hydrolytic and acidification-associated microbes and enriched the abundance of Methanosaeta sp. This work is expected to develop an innovative technology that will simultaneously enhance energy production from WAS in the sludge treatment line and improve biological nutrient removal in the wastewater treatment line of WWTPs.","Guo, HX; Wang, YF; Tian, LX; Wei, W; Zhu, TT; Liu, YW",Polyoxometalates (POMs); Sludge pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Energy recovery; Methane,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.125934,Chemical,oxidizer,polyoxometalates,activated sludge,secondary sludge,,,,,,,,,
Thermal Hydrolysis of Municipal sludge: Finding the Temperature Sweet Spot: A Review,"The increasing demand for a Thermal Hydrolysis Process (THP) to pretreat municipal sludge upstream Anaerobic Digestion (AD) opens the opportunity to further develop and optimise this technology. The optimal THP temperature remains unclear due to the production of refractory compounds at high temperature. A compilation of literature data was conducted to investigate the existence of a temperature sweet spot for the THP applied to municipal sludge. All related reports (n = 43) were included. The THP temperature range impact was assessed in the range of 100 degrees C-200 degrees C on four AD and dewatering performance indicators (CH(4)production, Volatile Solid Reduction (VSR), Dewaterability (DW) and filtrate quality). Other parameters potentially affecting the performance indicators were also considered. These parameters include the type of sewage sludge and operational conditions related to THP and AD. The impact of all parameters on performance indicators was evaluated with a Kruskal-Wallis statistical test. For THP temperature optimisation, a pairwise comparison, using a Wilcoxon test, was made. A temperature optimum in the [140-160] degrees C range was proposed. It seemed to minimize the production of refractory compounds, while maximising AD and dewatering performances. It is noteworthy that above 160 degrees C, the concentration in refractory compounds and soluble COD increases sharply, thus leading to a potential deterioration of WWTP effluent quality.

Mixture of primary and secondary municipal wastewater sludge as a short-term substrate in 2 MW agricultural biogas plant: site-specific sustainability of enzymatic and ultrasound pretreatments,"BACKGROUND: A mixture of primary and secondary municipal wastewater sludge (WWS) was tested in 40 day semi-continuous experiments as substrate for biogas production in a 2 MW agricultural biogas plant. To support industrial decision making during periods of substrate shortage seasonal extremes in sludge characteristics, effectiveness of ultrasonic and enzymatic pretreatments and their dual combinations were explored. RESULTS: Reanalysis of published data showed complex nonlinear relationship between specific ultrasound energy and disintegration degree of various WWS. The 51 bench-top reactor approach demonstrated a short adaptation period (15 days) to WWS and an increase in methane yields of 7.5%, 14.9% and 24.5% for the most effective ultrasound, hydrolytic and dual WWS pretreatments, respectively. The observed methane yields were notably lower from past batch experiments (Methane Yield Database V1.3). From the perspective of a 2 MW agricultural plant only enzymatic pretreatments of WWS were sustainable for full-scale deployment due to significantly lower costs of equipment installation, operation and maintenance. CONCLUSION: The approach described in this study allowed for sustainability analyses to be performed on site-specific basis, supported decision making on the most effective WWS pretreatment and provided the first full description of research protocols for effective assessment that can be extended to Standard Operating Procedures.

Optimization of hydrolysis and volatile fatty acids production from sugarcane filter cake: Effects of urea supplementation and sodium hydroxide pretreatment,"Different methods for optimization the anaerobic digestion (AD) of sugarcane filter cake (FC) with a special focus on volatile fatty acids (VFA) production were studied.

Enhanced methane production from anaerobic digestion of hybrid Pennisetum by selectively removing lignin with sodium chlorite,"To enhance the biodegradability and methane production of hybrid Pennisetum, a pretreatment method with high selectivity for lignin removal, namely sodium chlorite/acetic acid (SCA) pretreatment, was examined in this work. Results showed that SCA pretreatment can selectively remove lignin with minimal impact on cellulose and hemicellulose. After up to 200 min of SCA treatment, 79.4% of lignin was removed and over 90% of the holo-cellulose was retained. The physicochemical changes after pretreatment were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, X-ray diffractometer and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, showing that the majority of lignin was removed from secondary cell walls and cell middle lamella while the chlorite-resistant lignin remained in the cell corner. Lignin removal significantly enhanced the biodegradability from 59.6% to 86.4% and increased methane production by 38.3%.

Results showed that SCA pretreatment can selectively remove lignin with minimal impact on cellulose and hemicellulose. After up to 200 min of SCA treatment, 79.4% of lignin was removed and over 90% of the holo-cellulose was retained. The physicochemical changes after pretreatment were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, X-ray diffractometer and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, showing that the majority of lignin was removed from secondary cell walls and cell middle lamella while the chlorite-resistant lignin remained in the cell corner. Lignin removal significantly enhanced the biodegradability from 59.6% to 86.4% and increased methane production by 38.3%. Energy balance showed that SCA pretreatment was efficient to increase the energy output of hybrid Pennisetum.","Kang, XH; Zhang, Y; Li, LH; Sun, YM; Kong, XY; Yuan, ZH",Lignin removal; Energy crop; Pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Energy balance,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.122289,Biological,fungi,,lignocellulose,Pennisetum,grass,,,,,,,,
Thermal-alkaline pretreatment of polyacrylamide flocculated waste activated sludge: Process optimization and effects on anaerobic digestion and polyacrylamide degradation,"Deterioration of anaerobic digestion can occur with the presence of polyacrylamide (PAM) in waste activated sludge, and little information on mitigating this deterioration is currently available. In this study, simultaneous mitigation of PAM negative effects and improvement of methane production was accomplished by thermal-alkaline pretreatment. Under the optimized pretreatment conditions (i.e., 75 degrees C, pH 11.0 for 17.5 h), the bio-chemical methane potential of PAM-flocculated sludge increased from 100.5 to 210.8 mL/g VS and the hydrolysis rate increased from 0.122 to 0.187 d(-1). Mechanism investigations revealed that the pretreatment not only broke the large firm floccules, improved the degradation of PAM, but also facilitated the release of biodegradable organics from sludge, which thereby provided better growth environment and enough nutrients to anaerobic microbes for methane production. The activities of key enzymes responsible for methane production and PAM degradation were greatly improved in pretreated reactor, with the accumulation of acrylamide being avoided.","Liu, XR; Xu, QX; Wang, DB; Yang, Q; Wu, YX; Li, YF; Fu, QZ; Yang, F; Liu, YW; Ni, BJ; Wang, QL; Li, XM",Waste activated sludge; Polyacrylamide; Thermal-alkaline; Pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.02.095,Physical,thermal,,activated sludge,secondary sludge,,,,,,,,,

"Comprehensive insights into the impact of pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of waste active sludge from perspectives of organic matter composition, thermodynamics, and multi-omics","Although various pretreatments have been applied to promote the anaerobic digestion of waste active sludge (WAS), the mechanisms regarding the impact of pretreatment on anaerobic digestion have not been well addressed. In this study, the effects of acid, alkali, and thermal pretreatments on anaerobic digestion of WAS were comprehensively investigated from the perspectives of organic matter composition, thermodynamics, and multi-omics. Results showed acid, alkali, and thermal pretreatments increased the methane production potential of WAS by 53.7%, 98.2%, and 101.8%, respectively, compared with the control. The protein secondary structure was disrupted after pretreatment, with a shift from alpha-helix and beta-sheet to random coil and antiparallel beta-sheet/ aggregated strands. Thermodynamically, the WAS flocculation process was controlled by the short-range interfacial interactions described by the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) theory, which was positively correlated (R = 0.97, p < 0.05) with the organic matter solubilization of the WAS. After pre-treatment, the flocculation energy barrier of pretreated WAS was 4.1 (acid), 7.0 (alkali) and 7.1 (thermal) times higher than that of the control group, respectively. Multi-omics analysis confirmed that pretreatment promoted amino acids (tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, aspartate, glutamate) metabolism, energy metabolism (ABC transporters) and vitamin metabolism. Moreover, the comparison of upregulated differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) revealed that for amino acid metabolism, thermal treatment had the best promotion effect; for carbo-hydrate metabolism, alkali treatment had the best promotion effect; and for lipid metabolism, acid treatment was more advantageous, resulting in different anaerobic digestion efficiencies.

Enhancement of volatile fatty acids production from rice straw via anaerobic digestion with chemical pretreatment,"Rice straw is one of the most abundant renewable biomass sources and was selected as the feedstock for the production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) from which microbial biodiesel can be produced.

This research showed that solubilization of WAS is effective to the digester performance through measuring the unit gas production, volatile fatty acids (VFA), pH, and volatile mass reduction efficiency. WAS pretreatment allowed a decrease in the digester SRT from 13 to 6 days, without major effects on process efficiency and on effluent quality. It enhanced volatile mass reduction and unit gas production. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Methane Production from Feather Waste Pretreated with Ca(OH)(2): Process Development and Economical Analysis,"This study investigated the industrial application of feather waste as a substrate for anaerobic digestion. Feather was pretreated with 0-0.2 Ca(OH)(2) g/g TSfeather (total solids of feathers) for 30-120 min at 100-120 degrees C, in order to increase the digestibility, and to enhance the methane yield in a subsequent digestion at 55 degrees C. Based on the results of the batch digestion, an industrial process was developed, which can achieve 0.40 Nm(3)/kgVS(feather) (volatile solids of feathers) methane yield from the pretreated feathers, while it fulfills the animal by-product hygenization requirements as well. This base case of the industrial pretreatment process was designed using SuperPro Designer (R) for utilizing 2,500 tons of feathers per year, which is the waste stream from an average slaughterhouse with a capacity of 60,000 broilers per day. The production cost of the methane is estimated to be 0.475 EUR/Nm(3), while the investments on the pretreatment unit requires 0.97 million EUR as total capital investment, and 0.25 million EUR/year for operating cost. However, the process is sensitive to the plant capacity. Changing the plant capacity from 625 to 10,000 tons of feather per year, results in reducing the biogas production cost from 1.177 to 0.203 EUR/Nm(3). In addition, sensitivity analysis was performed on the base case to investigate the effect of the value of the incoming feather on the overall process profitability. The results showed that the proposed investment could be considered as being financially viable in the case of production of upgraded biomethane even without the current gate fee system.","Forgacs, G; Niklasson, C; Horvath, IS; Taherzadeh, MJ",Feather; Anaerobic digestion; Alkaline pretreatment; Process development; Economical analysis,2014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-013-9221-3,Chemical,alkaline,caoh,other,feather,waste,,,,,,,,
Improvement of methane production from waste paper by pretreatment with rumen fluid,"Cellulose hydrolysis is the rate-limiting step in anaerobic digestion. In the present study, waste paper was used as a model of cellulosic biomass and was pretreated with rumen fluid prior to methane production. To achieve a high methane yield, the reaction time of the pretreatment was examined. Waste paper was soaked with rumen fluid for 6 and 24 h at 37 degrees C. Various volatile fatty acids, especially acetate, were produced by the pretreatment. Semicontinuous methane production was carried out over a 20-day period. The best daily methane yield was obtained by the 6-h pretreatment. The amount was 2.6 times higher than that of untreated paper, which resulted in 73.4% of the theoretical methane yield. During methane production, the cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin degradabilities were improved by the pretreatment. Pretreatment by rumen fluid is therefore a powerful method to accelerate the methane yield from a cellulosic biomass. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

But for soluble solids, the thermoalkaline pretreatment decreases the reaction rates by inducing a competitive inhibition on the thermophilic anaerobic digestion rate while in the mesophilic range, a non-competitive inhibition is observed. A mathematical simulation of the consecutive reactions, suspended solids to dissolved solids and to methane in staged anaerobic thermophilic-mesophilic digestion, shows that with 4% suspended solids concentration it is better not to use a thermoalkaline pretreatment because overall solids reduction and total methane production are not as good as without pretreatment.","Vigueras-Carmona, SE; Ramirez, F; Noyola, A; Monroy, O",anaerobic digestion; hydrolysis; surface area; thermochemical pretreatment; wasted sludge,2011,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2011.726,Physical,thermal,,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,

Slaughterhouse fatty waste saponification to increase biogas yield,"A thermochemical pretreatment, i.e. saponification, was optimised in order to improve anaerobic biodegradation of slaughterhouse wastes such as aeroflotation grease and flesh fats from cattle carcass. Anaerobic digestion of raw wastes, as well as of wastes saponified at different temperatures (60 degrees C, 120 degrees C and 150 degrees C) was conducted in fed-batch reactors under mesophilic condition and the effect of different saponification temperatures on anaerobic biodegradation and on the long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) relative composition was assessed. Even after increasing loads over a long period of time, raw fatty wastes were biodegraded slowly and the biogas potentials were lower than those of theoretical estimations. In contrast, pretreated wastes exhibited improved batch biodegradation, indicating a better initial bio-availability, particularly obvious for carcass wastes. However, LCFA relative composition was not significantly altered by the pretreatment. Consequently, the enhanced biodegradation should be attributed to an increased initial bio-availability of fatty wastes without any modification of their long chain structure which remained slowly biodegradable.

Pretreatment of polysaccharidic wastes with cellulolytic Aspergillus fumigatus for enhanced production of biohythane in a dual-stage process,"Biological pretreatment of polysaccharidic wastes (PWs) is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach to improve the digestibility and utilization of these valuable substrates in dual-stage biohythane production. In order to reduce the prolonged incubation time and loss of carbohydrate during the pretreatment of PWs with Aspergillus fumigatus, a systematic optimization using Taguchi methodology resulted in an unprecedented recovery of soluble carbohydrates (362.84 mg g(-1)) within 5 days. The disruption and fragmentation of lignocellulosic structures in PWs, and possible saccharification of cellulose and hemicellulose components, increased its digestibility. A dual-stage biohythane production with pretreated PWs showed increased yield (214.13 mL g(-1) VSadded), which was 56% higher than the corresponding value with the untreated PWs.

Techno-economic study of NMMO pretreatment and biogas production from forest residues,"Biogas is nowadays getting more attention as a means for converting wastes and lignocelluloses to green fuels for cars and electricity production. The process of biogas production from N-methylmorpholine oxide (NMMO) pretreated forest residues used in a co-digestion process was economically evaluated. The co-digestion occurs together with the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). The process simulated the milling of the lignocelluloses, NMMO pretreatment unit, washing and filtration of the feedstock, followed by an anaerobic co-digestion, upgrading of the biogas and de-watering of the digestate. The process also took into consideration the utilization of 100,000 DW (dried weight) tons of forest residues and 200,000 DW tons of OFMSW per year. It resulted in an internal rate of return (IRR) of 24.14% prior to taxes, which might be attractive economically. The cost of the chemical NMMO treatment was regarded as the most challenging operating cost, followed by the evaporation of the washing water. Sensitivity analysis was performed on different plant size capacities, treating and digesting between 25,000 and 400,000 DW tons forest residues per year. It shows that the minimum plant capacity of 50,000 DW tons forest residues per year is financially viable. Moreover, different co-digestion scenarios were evaluated. The co-digestion of forest residues together with sewage sludge instead of OFMSW, and the digestion of forest residues only were shown to be non-feasible solutions with too low IRR. Furthermore, biogas production from forest residues was compared with the energy produced during combustion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Biohydrogen and Methane Production from Sugarcane Leaves Pretreated by Deep Eutectic Solvents and Enzymatic Hydrolysis by Cellulolytic Consortia,"This study determined the optimal conditions for the deep eutectic solvent (DES) pretreatment of sugarcane leaves and the best fermentation mode for hydrogen and methane production from DES-pretreated sugarcane leaves. Choline chloride (ChCl):monoethanolamine (MEA) is the most effective solvent for removing lignin from sugarcane leaves. The optimum conditions were a ChCl: MEA molar ratio of 1:6, 120 degrees C, 3 h, and substrate-to-DES solution ratio of 1:12. Under these conditions, 86.37 +/- 0.36% lignin removal and 73.98 +/- 0.42% hemicellulose removal were achieved, whereas 84.13 +/- 0.77% cellulose was recovered. At a substrate loading of 4 g volatile solids (VS), the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) and separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) processes yielded maximum hydrogen productions of 3187 +/- 202 and 2135 +/- 315 mL H-2/L, respectively. In the second stage, methane was produced using the hydrogenic effluent. SSF produced 5923 +/- 251 mL CH4/L, whereas SHF produced 3583 +/- 128 mL CH4/L. In a one-stage methane production process, a maximum methane production of 4067 +/- 320 mL CH4/L with a substrate loading of 4 g VS was achieved from the SSF process. SSF proved to be more efficient than SHF for producing hydrogen from DES-pretreated sugarcane leaves in a two-stage hydrogen and methane production process as well as a one-stage methane production process.","Miftah, AK; Sittijunda, S; Imai, T; Salakkam, A; Reungsang, A",ionic liquid; anaerobic digestion; lignocellulosic biomass; pretreatment; clean energy,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation8080396,Chemical,solvent,deep eutectic solvent,lignocellulose,sugarcane,leaves,,,,,,,,
Effects of liquid digestate pretreatment on biogas production for anaerobic digestion of wheat straw,"In this study, the effects of liquid digestate pretreatment of wheat straw on its biogas production efficiency and anaerobic digestion were investigated using a laboratory-scale biochemical methane potential test. Scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to analyze the changes in main compositions and physico-chemical structure of wheat straw after different pretreatment durations (3 days, 5 days, and 7 days). The results evidenced that liquid digestate pretreatment can dissolve the lignocellulosic structure, which positively promoted anaerobic biogas production. Liquid digestate pretreatment achieved a satisfactory anaerobic digestion efficiency with wheat straw as the substrate. Furthermore, the production of biogas and methane were also found to increase after pretreatment. Thus, it was concluded that a duration of 5-day liquid digestate pretreatment was optimal as it yielded 39.76% more biogas production, and 49.58% more biomethane yield, in 35.71% shorter digestion time (T-80) as compared to raw wheat straw. The modified Gompertz model was able to explain the kinetic behavior during anaerobic digestion of wheat straw. Based on the aforementioned experimental observations, a comparison between effects of equivalent NH4+-N concentration of ammonia solution and liquid digestate pretreatment was conducted, which indicated that ammonolysis played crucial role in the enhancement of biogas production process by pretreated liquid digestate.","Liu, T; Zhou, XQ; Li, ZF; Wang, XM; Sun, JC",Wheat straw anaerobic digestion; Pretreatment; Liquid digestate; Ammonia solution,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.01.147,Biological,biological active substrate,digestate ,lignocellulose,wheat,straw,95,90.25,,,44,,,
The effect of an enzymatic pretreatment on the hydrolysis and size reduction of fat particles in slaughterhouse wastewater,"The effect of an enzymatic pretreatment, Pancreatic Lipase 250 (PL-250), on the hydrolysis and size reduction of fat particles in slaughterhouse wastewater was characterised for enzyme doses ranging from 125 to 1000mg dm(-3) and initial particle sizes (D-in) varying between 53 and 383 mum. Treatment with PL-250 significantly reduced the size of pork fat particles in slaughterhouse wastewater. Particle size reduction increased with D-in, possibly due to the more filamentous and plate-like configuration of the larger fat particles, which could be easily broken at weak points. The smaller particles were observed to be denser and more spherical. Size reduction also increased with enzyme concentration, but the benefit of adding more enzyme diminished greatly as enzyme dose was increased. The maximum long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) concentration in filtered samples was detected after 4-7h of treatment and ranged from 8.2 to 34.9mg dm-3. The linear rate of LCFA released in solution during enzymatic pretreatment ranged from 39.4 to 169.9mg dm(-3) d(-1), and increased with enzyme concentration up to 500mgdm(-3). At a PL-250 concentration of 1000mgdm(-3), the LCFA release rate decreased, maybe due to excessive layering of adsorbed enzyme on the fat particles or increased degradation of released LCFAs. The pretreatment appeared to be more efficient with beef than pork fat particles. However, the effect of an enzymatic pretreatment on a downstream anaerobic treatment of slaughterhouse wastewater containing fat particles remains to be tested.

Microbial mechanism underlying high methane production of coupled alkali-microwave-H2O2-oxidation pretreated sewage sludge by in-situ bioelectrochemical regulation,"The stabilization and disposal of the large amounts of sewage sludge pose a worldwide challenging problem. To solve this problem, the technical feasibility of coupled alkali-microwave-H2O2-oxidation pretreatment with in-situ bioelectrochemical regulation was used for enhancing sludge biodegradability and methane productivity. The optimum condition of the combined pretreatment was pH 10.0 +/- 0.1, microwave 700 W and H2O2 0.4 g/g TS. In this case, soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) of pre-treated sludge was increased from initial 330.9 +/- 10.0 to 3328.8 +/- 49.6 mg/L. The highest accumulative methane yield of 234.3 mL CH4/g VS was obtained for pretreated sludge at the cathodic potential of -0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl, increasing by 4.3-, and 1.9-fold compared with the raw and pretreated sludge, respectively. The microbial community analysis further provided a compelling evidence that bio-electrochemical regulation stimulated the growth of the functional microorganisms, especially in protein-degrading (Firmicutes), polysaccharides-utilizing (Chloroflexi), electroactive (Geobacter, and Desulfomicrobium) and methane-producing (Methanobacterium) microorganisms. In addition, pH adjustment of pretreated sludge by addition of H2SO4 could further enrich the abundance of microbial community and build a strong syntrophic interaction, accordingly provoking the hydrolysis and subsequent methane production.

Influence of steam explosion pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion of vinegar residue,"Vinegar residue is the by-product in the vinegar production process. The large amount of vinegar residue has caused a serious environmental problem owing to its acidity and corrosiveness. Anaerobic digestion is an effective way to convert agricultural waste into bioenergy, and a previous study showed that vinegar residue could be treated by anaerobic digestion but still had room to improve digestion efficiency. In this study, steam explosion at pressure of 0.8, 1.2, and 1.5MPa and residence time of 5, 10, 15, and 20min were used to pretreat vinegar residue to improve methane production, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analyses were applied to validate structural changes of vinegar residue after steam explosion. Results showed that steam explosion pretreatment could destroy the structure of lignocellulose by removing the hemicellulose and lignin, and improve the methane yield effectively. Steam explosion-treated vinegar residue at 0.8MPa for 5min produced the highest methane yield of 153.58mLg(VS)(-1), which was 27.65% (significant, <0.05) more than untreated vinegar residue (120.31mLg(VS)(-1)). The analyses of pH, total ammonia-nitrogen, total alkalinity, and volatile fatty acids showed that steam explosion did not influence the stability of anaerobic digestion. This study suggested that steam explosion pretreatment on vinegar residue might be a promising approach and it is worth further study to improve the efficiency of vinegar residue waste utilisation.","Feng, JY; Zhang, JY; Zhang, JF; He, YF; Zhang, RH; Liu, GQ; Chen, C",Vinegar residue; steam explosion; pretreatment; anaerobic digestion; methane production,2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0734242X16644681,Physical,thermal,steam explosion,lignocellulose,vinegar residue,processing waste,35,32,49,2,28,25,34,16
"Improved anaerobic digestion of a thermally pretreated mixture of physicochemical sludge; broiler excreta and sugar cane wastes (SCW): Effect on organic matter solubilization, biodegradability and bioenergy production","Thermal pretreatment effect of a mixture of organic wastes (physicochemical sludge, excreta of broiler chickens and sugarcane wastes (SCW)) in the solubilization and biodegradability organic matter as well as bioenergy production by anaerobic digestion was evaluated. Two different mixtures of physicochemical sludge, excreta of broiler chickens and SCW (70%, 15%, 15% and 60%, 20%, 20% of VS, respectively) were treated at different temperatures (80 degrees C, 85 degrees C and 90 degrees C) and contact time (30, 60 and 90min). Results indicate that, organic matter solubilization degree increased from 1.14 to 6.56%; subsequently, in the anaerobic digestion process, an increase of 50% in the volatile solids removal and 10% in biogas production was observed, while, retention time decreased from 23 up to 9days. The results obtained were similar to pilot-scale. In both experimental scales it showed that the synergy produced by the simultaneous anaerobic digestion of different substrates could increase bioenergy production up to 1.3L bio g(-1) VS removed and 0.82L CH4 g(-1) VS removed. The treatment conditions presented in this study allow for large residue quantities to be treated and large bioenergy quantities to be produced (10% higher than during conventional treatment) without increasing the anaerobic digester volume.","Nava-Valente, N; Alvarado-Lassman, A; Nativitas-Sandoval, LS; Mendez-Contreras, JM",thermal pretreatment; bioenergy production; Anaerobic digestion; organic matter solubilization,2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2015.1120542,Physical,thermal,,codigestion,"chicken manure, sugar cane waste",,,,,,,,,
Making lignin accessible for anaerobic digestion by wet-explosion pretreatment,"Lignin is a major part of the recalcitrant fraction of lignocellulose and in nature its degradation occurs through oxidative enzymes along with microbes mediated oxidative chemical actions. Oxygen assisted wet-explosion pretreatment promotes lignin solubility and leads to an increase biodegradation of lignin during anaerobic digestion processes. The pretreatment of feedlot manure was performed in a 10 L reactor at 170 degrees C for 25 min using 4 bars oxygen and the material was fed to a continuous stirred tank reactor operated at 55 degrees C for anaerobic digestion. Methane yield of untreated and pretreated material was 70 +/- 27 and 320 +/- 36 L/kg-VS/Day, respectively, or 4.5 times higher yield as a result of the pretreatment. Aliphatic acids formed during the pretreatment were utilized by microbes. 44.4% lignin in pretreated material was actually converted in the anaerobic digestion process compared to 12.6% for untreated material indicating the oxygen assisted explosion promoted lignin degradation.

Assessment of pretreatment and digestion temperature on anaerobic digestion of whiskey byproducts and microbial taxonomy,"The effects of steam and sulfuric acid pretreatment on anaerobic digestion (AD) of whiskey byproducts (including draff, thin and thick stillage) were investigated in order to improve the digestion performance under both mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures. The results of biomethane potential assays suggested that thermophilic AD facilitated the release of free ammonia (ca. 1200 mg/L) from byproducts, resulting in strong ammonia inhibition and volatile fatty acid accumulation. In contrast, no free ammonia inhibition (ca. 700 mg/L) was observed under mesophilic AD; the methane yield from mesophilic AD was between 375.3 +/- 13.6 mL/g volatile solid (VS; acid-treated sample) and 389.1 +/- 8.5 mL/g VS (untreated sample).

Optimization of hydrothermal pretreatment conditions for mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion of high-solid sludge,"Hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) conditions were optimized for continuous mesophilic (MAD) and thermophilic (TAD) anaerobic digestion of high-solid sludge (10-11% total solids). COD solubilization increased with prolonged HTP durations, and became not significant after 210 min. According to the methane production rate and energy consumption, the optimal HTP temperature was determined at 160 degrees C. Regarding continuous operation without HTP, TAD achieved higher methane yield and volatile solids (VS) reduction, at 0.12 L/g VSadded and 23.9%, respectively. After HTP, methane yield and VS reduction in MAD and TAD were increased by 400% and 191% (MAD), 67% and 72% (TAD), respectively. TAD was limited due to the inhibition from about 2800 mg/L of NH4+-N concentration. The methanogenic activity of MAD was enhanced, whereas TAD displayed a reduced value owing to ammonia inhibition. Ultimately, MAD with HTP and TAD without HTP achieved the higher energy balance, 5.25 and 3.27 kJ/g VS, respectively.","Wu, LJ; Li, XX; Liu, YX; Yang, F; Zhou, Q; Ren, RP; Lyu, YK",Anaerobic digestion; High-solid sludge; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Mesophilic; Thermophilic,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.124454,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,activated sludge,dewatered sludge,,11,4,,,,,,

Maximizing the energy potential of urban sludge treatment: An experimental study and a scenario-based energy analysis focusing on anaerobic digestion with ultrasound pretreatment and sludge combustion,"With stricter regulations and concerns over sustainability, combustion can be a beneficial handling method as dried sludge can be used as an energy source. Anaerobic digestion of sludge also provides energy in the form of biogas without the need for sludge drying. Yet, anaerobic digestion reduces the calorific value (CV) of sludge. In this study, the effect of anaerobic digestion (with or without ultrasound pretreatment) on the fuel properties of sludge were examined through laboratory experiments. Addi-tionally, a number of sludge management strategies were evaluated to maximize energy gain. Temporal changes in fuel properties of sludge were tracked during digestion. Results showed that sonication provided a 3.4-fold increase in soluble COD, 15% increase in biogas production and 32% increase in methane production, while the CV of sludge reduced from 14.7 kJ/g to 10 kJ/g. Energy balances for a number of sludge management process trains showed that the optimal method was the combination of thickening, dewatering, thermal drying and combustion. Addition of digestion and ultrasound pre-treatment to this scenario reduced the energy gained from sludge. Yet, high ambient temperatures impacted results such that the net energy gain by the scenario including digestion and combustion was close to that of combustion only. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Results showed that the experimental methane yield of SG after pretreatment was enhanced from 46.3 mL(STP) g(vs)(-1) to a maximum value of 197.2 mL(STP) g(vs)(-1), with an improvement of 325.6%. Methane production process of SG after different pretreatments was well simulated by the modified Gompertz model. Meanwhile, structural and composition changes of SG after pretreatment were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and component analysis.

Combination of Dry Milling and Separation Processes with Anaerobic Digestion of Olive Mill Solid Waste: Methane Production and Energy Efficiency,"This experimental work aims at investigating the effects of milling; sieving; and electrostatic separation on the biochemical methane potential of two olive pomaces from traditional olive oil extraction (M) and from a three-phase system (T). Sieving proved to be efficient for increasing the soluble chemical oxygen demand in the smallest fractions of the sieve of both M (62%) and T (78%) samples. The positive fraction following electrostatic separation also enhanced chemical oxygen demand (COD) solubilisation by 94%, in comparison to sample T milled at 4 mm. Sieve fractions with a size greater than 0.9 mm contained 33% and 47% less lipids for the M and T biomasses; respectively. Dry fractionation modified sample properties as well as lipid and fiber distribution. Concomitantly; milling increased the accessibility and facilitated the release of organic matter. The energy balance was positive after knife milling and sieving; while ball milling and ultrafine milling proved to be inefficient.","Elalami, D; Carrere, H; Abdelouahdi, K; Oukarroum, A; Dhiba, D; Arji, M; Barakat, A",anaerobic digestion; pretreatment; energy efficiency; electrostatic separation; milling; sieving,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules23123295,Physical,mechanical desintegration,"milling dry,sieving",lignocellulose,olive,pomace,,,,,,,,
A comparison of different pre-treatments to increase methane production from two agricultural substrates,"To enhance the methane production from ensiled sorghum forage and wheat straw, thermal, alkaline and thermo-alkaline pre-treatments were performed in batch mode. Alkaline pretreatment was conducted at 40 degrees C for 24 h with the addition of 1% and 10% gNaOH/gTS; thermal and thermo-alkaline pre-treatments at 100 degrees C, and 160 C for 30 min, with and without the addition of NaOH solutions at the above dosages. All the pre-treatments tested led to a solubilization of the organic matter, with a maximum concentration (around 30-40% for both substrates) obtained at 40 and 100 C with 10% NaOH. Furthermore, a reduction in the fibrous fractions was observed for both substrates. The highest lignin reduction, compared to untreated samples, was found at 100 degrees C with 10% NaOH dosage (53% and 72% for wheat straw and sorghum, respectively). Under this pre-treatment condition a high hemicelluloses reduction yield was also found (63% for both substrates). The highest increase in methane yield (up to 32%), compared to the untreated substrate was observed at 40 degrees C with 10% NaOH for sorghum. As for wheat straw, significant increases in methane yield were observed at 40 degrees C with 10% NaOH (43%) and at 100 degrees C with 1-10% NaOH (48% and 67%, respectively). According to the results of the preliminary economic analysis, the pretreatments seemed to be sustainable for both substrates, especially for wheat straw, due to a higher methane yield increase than that of sorghum.

Biomethane potential of food waste: modeling the effects of mild thermal pretreatment and digestion temperature,"In order to enhance anaerobic biodegradability of food waste (FW), thermal pretreatment was applied. The effectiveness in terms of biodegradability extent and process rate improvement was investigated. To this aim, Biomethane Potential tests were carried out under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. The IWA anaerobic digestion Model 1 (ADM1), a powerful tool for modeling the anaerobic digestion (AD) of different substrates, was implemented to predict the methane production. Disintegration constant (k_dis) and maximum acetate uptake rate (km_ac) were identified as the most sensitive parameters and were calibrated over the observed methane production. Pretreatment improvement was more evident in enhancing parameters related to the process rate, such as solubilization extent (+153%) and disintegration constant (+18%), rather than increasing substrate biodegradability. Thermophilic conditions proved to be effective in speeding up the whole AD process, since all the kinetics were significantly improved (disintegration rate increased up to fivefold). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that, after k_dis and km_ac calibration, default thermophilic ADM1 parameters can be suitable to model FW digestion.","Montecchio, D; Gallipoli, A; Gianico, A; Mininni, G; Pagliaccia, P; Braguglia, CM",Food waste; thermal pretreatment; anaerobic digestion; kinetic parameters; ADM1,2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2016.1233293,Physical,thermal,,food waste,kitchen waste,,,,,,,,,

Particle Size Reduction during Harvesting of Crop Feedstock for Biogas Production I: Effects on Ensiling Process and Methane Yields,"Shortening chopping length at harvest of biogas crops is a basic method of mechanical pretreatment that potentially affects subsequent conservation and biogas production processes. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of a wider range of particle size distributions achieved by laboratory chopping and of practice-oriented short and very short chopping lengths induced by forage harvesters, respectively, on ensiling parameters and methane formation. Shortening the cutting length enhanced lactic acid fermentation during ensiling and increased methane yield, although the effects of ensilage products on methane production partly overlaid the direct positive influence due to reduced particle size. A maximum increase in methane yield of 11 % to 13 % was obtained in the range of median particle lengths of 33 to 6 mm when taking storage losses into account.

Influence of thermal hydrolysis pretreatment on physicochemical properties and anaerobic biodegradability of waste activated sludge with different solids content,"The influence of thermal hydrolysis pretreatment (THP) on physicochemical properties (pH, total solids, volatile solids, chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, volatile fatty acids, viscosity, and cell morphology) and anaerobic biodegradability of highly concentrated waste activated sludge (WAS) with TS content ranging from 1 to 7% was evaluated at different temperatures ranging from 100 to 220 degrees C. The biomethane potential (BMP) of the WAS was systematically analyzed and evaluated. Images of its cellular structure were also analyzed. The results indicated that THP is a useful method for solubilizing volatile solids and enhancing CH4 production regardless of the TS content of the WAS feed. The ultimate CH4 production determined from the BMP analysis was 313-348 L CH4/kg VS (72.6-74.1% CH4) at the optimum THP temperature of 180 degrees C. The results showed that THP could improve both the capacity and efficiency of anaerobic digestion, even at a high TS content, and could achieve the dual purpose of sludge reduction and higher energy recovery.

"Influence of cavitation, pelleting, extrusion and torrefaction petreatments on anaerobic biodegradability of barley straw and vine shoots","When dealing with lignocellulosic biomass in anaerobic digestion, a pretreatment stage is always required to open the structure of the material, facilitating its degradation. Numerous methods have been developed to pretreat lignocellulosic biomass. Four of them: cavitation, pelleting, extrusion and torrefaction have been comparatively studied in this paper as ways to improve the production of methane by anaerobic digestion of two different feedstocks: barley straw and vine shoots. Additionally, how the selected pretreatments and the nature of the feedstock influence the formation of individual volatile fatty acids was examined. Cavitation was revealed as the most efficient pretreatment, increasing 240% and 360% the methane production for barley straw and vine shoots, respectively, although in absolute terms, barley straw has higher production rate and yield than vine shoots. Torrefaction carried out at 180 degrees C increased methane production, 81% for straw and 25% for vine shoots, while the process at higher temperatures (220 degrees C) negatively affected biogas production from both feedstocks.

Pyrolysis and anaerobic digestion of the Egeria Densa biomass in different pretreatment conditions for potential use as a substrate in the generation of bioproducts,"In recent years, the interest in clean and sustainable energy technologies has grown significantly. As an alternative to fossil fuels, organic raw materials can reduce the emission of pollutants and greenhouse gases, positively impacting the environment. Submerged aquatic plants, such as Egeria densa, have become an interesting alternative. Due to the high capacity for proliferation and its physicochemical characteristics, E. densa has potential in the generation of bio-oil and biogas for thermochemical and biological processes, respectively. Here, the authors study the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass and the feasibility of methane gas production through anaerobic digestion, after different pretreatments. The design of experiments (DOE) was used to investigate mass loss, biogas yield, and extractives content. Changes in surface morphology (coloration, roughness, and porosity), during pretreatment steps, were evaluated by colorimetric assays and scanning electronic microscopy. The kinetics of biogas production was modeled through a first-order equation. According to DOE results, the degradation of lignocellulose and the efficiency of methane production were favored by the alkaline pretreatment. The maximum yield of methane at 35 degrees C was 231.82 mL of CH4 g(-1) (VS). Changes in the chemical constitution of biomass pretreated with acid, via thermochemical strategy, were observed in colorimetric and microstructural tests, justified by the increase in the concentration of extracts. The maximum mass loss was 80 % (pyrolysis) after biomass was submitted to an acid catalyst. The results showed that the physically-chemically pre-treated aquatic macrophyte E. densa is a renewable source in bio-oil and methane production.","Dutra, JDF; Passos, MF; da Silva, TF; Mockaitis, G",Egeria densa; Chemical pretreatment; Factorial planning; Anaerobic digestion; Kinetic,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jwpe.2020.101772,Chemical,alkaline,,lignocellulose,egeria densa,plant,,,,,,,,
Effects of thermal pretreatment on the biomethane yield and hydrolysis rate of kitchen waste,"In this study, batch tests were performed to evaluate the effects of different thermal pretreatment temperatures (55-160 degrees C) and durations (15-120 min) on the anaerobic digestion of kitchen waste (KW). Two commonly used approaches, namely the modified Gompertz model and the approach developed by Koch and Drewes, were applied to assess the effects of the different pretreatment parameters on the biomethane yield, lag time and hydrolysis rate constant via data fitting. The subsequent anaerobic digestion of KW pretreated at 55-120 degrees C presented greater efficiency, and longer treatment durations resulted in increased methane production and higher hydrolysis rate constants. These findings were obtained due to the lower nutrient loss observed in KW treated at lower temperature treatments compared with that found with higher temperature treatments. In general, the effects of thermal pretreatment on the lag phase and hydrolysis rate differed depending on the treatment parameters leading to the variations in the KW compositions. The soundness of the two model results was evaluated, and higher statistical indicators (R-2) were found with the modified Gompertz model than with the approach developed by Koch and Drewes.

Effect of ultrasonic assisted KOH pretreatment on physiochemical characteristic and anaerobic digestion performance of wheat straw,"In this study, ultrasonic field was applied during potassium hydroxide (KOH) pretreatment of wheat straw (WS). Three concentrations of KOH (2%, 4%, and 6%) were tested during pretreatment. The results showed that there was a significant influence of the ultrasonic assisted KOH pretreatment (KOHUpt) on physiochemical characteristics of WS during pretreatment as well as on digester performance. The pretreatment time was optimized to 36 h for all KOH concentrations. The highest total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) productions (3189 mg.L-1) from 6% KOHUpt samples were observed. Similarly, the SEM analysis and FTIR observation revealed that KOHUpt effectively disrupted the physical morphology of WS and successful breaking of lignin and hemicellulose linkage between carboxyl groups. Moreover, the highest biogasification (555 ml.(g VSloaded)(-)(1)) and biomethane productions (282 ml.(g VSloaded)(-)(1))( )from 4%KOHUpt digesters, with 69% of biodegradability, indicated significant availability of organic matter from KOHUpt. The R-2 values (0.993-0.998) in Modified Gompertz Model indicated that the model was feasible to predict methane yield for this study. Similarly, the B-o values for 4%KOHUpt (283.30 +/- 2.74 ml.(g VSloaded)(-)(1)) were also in agreement to the experimental methane yield. These results suggested that ultrasonic addition during KOH pretreatment of WS can effectively increase the organic yield during pretreatment. Moreover, the increase in methane production from 4% H-Upt suggested that digester performance can be improved with lower KOH concentrations using this pretreatment.

Biomethane production improvement by hydrothermal pretreatment of thickened waste activated sludge,"This study evaluated the impact of hydrothermal pretreatment on thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS) for solubilization enhancement and biomethane production improvement through the mesophilic anaerobic digestion process. In order to assess the effect of temperature, retention time and severity index (SI) of the hydrothermal pretreatment, TWAS was exposed to fifteen different pretreatment conditions within a combination of 10 different pretreatment temperature range (150-240 degrees C), five different retention times (5-30 min) and five different severity indexes (SI = 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5 and 5). The solubilization enhancement was observed in all hydrothermally pretreated samples with the highest solubilization efficiency of 49% in pretreatment conditions of 200 degrees C and 10 min retention time within the corresponding SI = 4. Biomethane production was not improved in all fifteen pretreatment conditions, pretreatment with SI beyond 4 decreased the biodegradability of TWAS. The highest biomethane production was observed in the pretreatment condition of 170 degrees C and 10 min with a 40% increase compared to non-pretreated TWAS.","Razavi, AS; Kakar, F; Koupaie, EH; Hafez, H; Elbeshbishy, E",anaerobic digestion; biomethane recovery; hydrothermal pretreatment; solubilization; thickened waste activated sludge,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2020.598,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,activated sludge,thickened waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Aqueous Ammonia Soaking of Wheat Straw at Ambient Temperature for Enhancing the Methane Yield: Process Optimization by Response Surface Methodology,"Aqueous ammonia soaking (AAS) at ambient temperature was applied to wheat straw under different conditions in order to maximize the CH(4)yield through mesophilic anaerobic digestion. The effects of the NH(3)concentration, duration of AAS and solid-to-liquid ratio were studied on the resulting CH(4)yield and the solubilization degree of the pretreated wheat straw. A strong interaction among the NH(3)concentration and the duration of AAS was observed. The optimal conditions found were 18% w/w NH3, 7 days of duration and 50 g straw/L reagent, leading to a 43% increase of the CH(4)yield in 17 days of digestion. Compositional analysis of the optimally-treated wheat straw revealed that a significant solubilization of hemicellulose took place during AAS together with a moderate lignin removal (9%).

HPH and alkaline-heat pretreated grass clipping produced 418 and 405 ml biogas in anaerobic digestion respectively, both around 2.5 times higher than that of the control. Furthermore, both pretreated samples produced biogas immediately while the control had a two-day delay. HPH could produce more biogas in a shorter time and it could be operated in room temperature and needs no chemical, implying that HPH could be an effective pretreatment of biomass for biogas production.

"Evaluation of continuous mesophilic, thermophilic and temperature phased anaerobic digestion of microwaved activated sludge","The effects of microwave (MW) pretreatment, staging and digestion temperature on anaerobic digestion were investigated in a setup of ten reactors. A mesophilic reactor was used as a control. Its performance was compared to single-stage mesophilic and thermophilic reactors treating pretreated and non-pretreated sludge, temperature-phased (TPAD) thermophilic-mesophilic reactors treating pretreated and non-pretreated sludge and thermophilic thermophilic reactors also treating pretreated and non-pretreated sludge. Four different sludge retention times (SRTs) (20, 15, 10 and 5 d) were tested for all reactors. Two-stage thermo thermo reactors treating pretreated sludge produced more biogas than all other reactors and removed more volatile solids. Maximum volatile solids (VS) removal was 53.1% at an SRI of 15 d and maximum biogas increase relative to control was 106% at the shortest SRI tested. Both the maximum VS removal and biogas relative increase were measured for a system with thermophilic acidogenic reactor and thermophilic methanogenic reactor. All the two-stage systems treating microwaved sludge produced sludge free of pathogen indicator bacteria, at all tested conditions even at a total system SRI of only 5 d. MW pretreatment and staging reactors allowed the application of very short SRT (5 d) with no significant decrease in performance in terms of VS removal in comparison with the control reactor. MW pretreatment caused the solubilization of organic material in sludge but also allowed more extensive hydrolysis of organic material in downstream reactors. The association of MW pretreatment and thermophilic operation improves dewaterability of digested sludge. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Anaerobic Digestion of Wastewater Sludge and Alkaline-Pretreated Wheat Straw at Semi-Continuous Pilot Scale: Performances and Energy Assessment,"During the last decade, the application of pretreatment has been investigated to enhance methane production from lignocellulosic biomass such as wheat straw (WS). Nonetheless, most of these studies were conducted in laboratory batch tests, potentially hiding instability problems or inhibition, which may fail in truly predicting full-scale reactor performance. For this purpose, the effect of an alkaline pretreatment on process performance and methane yields from WS (0.10 g NaOH g(-1) WS at 90 degrees C for 1 h) co-digested with fresh wastewater sludge was evaluated in a pilot-scale reactor (20 L). Results showed that alkaline pretreatment resulted in better delignification (44%) and hemicellulose solubilization (62%) compared to untreated WS. Pilot-scale study showed that the alkaline pretreatment improved the methane production (261 +/- 3 Nm(3) CH4 t(-1) VS) compared to untreated WS (201 +/- 6 Nm(3) CH4 t(-1) VS). Stable process without any inhibition was observed and a high alkalinity was maintained in the reactor due to the NaOH used for pretreatment. The study thus confirms that alkaline pretreatment is a promising technology for full-scale application and could improve the overall economic benefits for biogas plant at 24 EUR t(-1) VS treated, improve the energy recovery per unit organic matter, reduce the digestate volume and its disposal costs.","Peyrelasse, C; Barakat, A; Lagnet, C; Kaparaju, P; Monlau, F",anaerobic digestion; batch tests; semi-continuous pilot; pretreatment; energy assessment,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14175391,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,lignocellulose,wheat,straw,,,,,,,,
Co-treatment of potassium ferrate and peroxymonosulfate enhances the decomposition of the cotton straw and cow manure mixture,"Since there is high lignocellulose content in the cotton straw and cow manure mixture (MCC), the appropriate MCC pretreatment is important to promote the anaerobic digestion (AD) hydrolysis. This study mainly explored the effect of potassium ferrate (PF) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) pretreatments on MCC decomposition. PMS + PF co-treatment showed a higher reduction of total solid and volatile solid than PF pretreatment and PMS pretreatment. Hydrolysis of treated MCC indicated that the PF pretreatment was more effective to the release of organics than the PMS pretreatment and the PMS + PF co-treatment. However, the PMS + PF co-treatment resulted in a higher lignin removal rate (40.4%-50.5%) than the PMS pretreatment (30.8%) and the PF pretreatment (21.4%). The PMS1 + PF2 co-treatment (molar ratio of 1:2) acquired the optimal lignin removal rate and the release of organics among the PMS + PF co-treatment with different dosing ratio. Potential mechanism was that PF reduction products activated PMS to produce free radicals (SO4 center dot-, center dot OH), which attacked lignocellulosic components and promoted MCC decomposition. The PMS1 + PF2 co-treatment was deduced to be the optimal pretreatment method when considering MCC decomposition, biodegradability, and mass transfer in the bioreactor. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Maximizing biogas production by pretreatment and by optimizing the mixture ratio of co-digestion with organic wastes,"Anaerobic digestion is a popular sewage sludge (Ss) treatment method as it provides significant pollution control and energy recovery. However, the low C/N ratio and poor biodegradability of Ss necessitate pretreatment methods that improve solubilization under anaerobic conditions in addition to anaerobic co-digestion with other substrates to improve the process efficiency. In this study, three pretreatment methods, namely microwave irradiation, ultrasonication, and heat treatment, were investigated, and the corresponding improvement in methane production was assessed. Additionally, the simplex centroid design method was utilized to determine the optimum mixture ratio of food waste (Fw), livestock manure (Lm), and Ss for maximum methane yield. Microwave irradiation at 700 W for 6 min yielded the highest biodegradability (62.0%), solubilization efficiency (59.7%), and methane production (329 mL/g VS). The optimum mixture ratio following pretreatment was 61.3% pretreated Ss, 28.6% Fw, and 10.1% Lm. The optimum mixture ratio without pretreatment was 33.6% un-pretreated Ss, 46.0% Fw, and 20.4% Lm. These results indicate that the choice of pretreatment method plays an important role in efficient anaerobic digestion and can be applied in operational plants to enhance methane production.

Effect of Pretreatment and Substrate Ratios in Biorefinery Employing Co-digestion of Plant Biomass and Poultry Waste,"The current study investigated the optimization of biogas generation during co-digestion of various plant biomasses with poultry waste at different ratios and pretreatment of plant biomass. The biochemical tests were executed at 35 degrees C in a thermostat. Water hyacinth was found as the suitable substrate for mono and co-digestion due to high volatile solids (VS) and total soluble contents. However, poultry waste was appropriate only if it was co-digested with other biomasses. The experiments evaluating biogas generation at different ratios of plant biomasses and poultry waste demonstrated that water hyacinth and poultry (50: 50) produced 262mL g(-1)VS, giant reed and poultry (80: 20) produced 235mL g(-1)VSwhile maize and poultry (60: 40) generated 193mL g(-1)VS. However, the pretreating the plant biomass with either Fenton's or Fenton's plus ultrasonic had no effect on biogas generation. The volumes of biogas generated after various pretreatment were low as compared to condition without pretreatment. The codigestion can be classified as WH: P (50: 50 > GR: P (80: 20) > M: P (60: 40). So, these ratios can be applied at decentralized scale for better wastemanagement and biogas generation due to balanced C: N ratio of plant biomass and poultry manure.

Anaerobic Co-Digestion of Tannery Wastes and Untreated/Pretreated Oat Straw,"The combination of carbon and nitrogen-rich co-substrates results in a better balance and increases the stability of the anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) process. In this work, the AcoD process of waste from the leather industry (shavings and sludge) with waste from agriculture (oat straw) was assessed with regard to the energy (biogas production) and waste treatment efficiency (reduction of organic matter). The results indicate that the addition of untreated oat straw improved the AcoD process, increasing biogas production (25.44 mL of cumulative biogas/g of VSS added) by almost 60% when compared to the AcoD of only leather waste (16.17 mL/gVSS). Also, the effect of acid, alkaline, thermal, and the combination of these pretreatment techniques was evaluated on the lignocellulosic composition of oat straw and on methane yields. Pretreatments improved the characteristics and bioavailability of oat straw, particularly in methodologies that use alkali, with a significant increase in cellulose content accompanied by a decrease in hemicellulose and lignin content. However, the possible formation of secondary products or sterilization of important microorganisms did not reflect in a greater production of biogas: 21.06 mL/gVSS for oat straw pretreated only with HCl and 21.91 mL/gVSS for oat straw pretreated with HCl in autoclave; 5.20 mL/gVSS for oat straw pretreated with NaOH; and 3.43 mL/gVSS for oat straw pretreated with NaOH in autoclave; thermal pretreatment probably has generated toxic compounds from hemicellulose and cellulose degradation, which inhibited the AcoD process and, as consequence, virtually no biogas was produced.","Simioni, T; Agustini, CB; Dettmer, A; Gutterres, M",Renewable energy; Anaerobic digestion; Lignocellulosic biomass; Leather waste; Pretreatment; Methane,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-021-10285-1,Chemical,acidic,,lignocellulose,oat,straw,,,,,,,,

"Enzyme pretreatment of yard waste to improve anaerobic biodegradability: Modeling the interactive effects of enzyme dose, treatment temperature and treatment duration on delignification","Laccase pretreatment of yard waste (YW) was conducted for improving its anaerobic biodegradability. The optimum pretreatment condition based on response surface methodology for maximum delignification was: solid loading 19.7% (w/v) of total solid, treatment duration 9 h, and pretreatment temperature 44.5 degrees C. The mechanism of biomass delignification was further investigated by the change in physical and chemical properties. Specifically the increase in water retention value (2.05 times), specific porosity (1.72 times), and crystallinity index (1.25 times) in pretreated YW indicates the capability of laccase pretreatment to remove lignin selectively. The methane yield after 30 days of anaerobic digestion for untreated YW was 294 +/- 12 mL/g volatile solid (VS) and for laccase pretreated yard waste at the optimum condition was 405 +/- 15 mL/gVS. The Modified Gompertz model showed the best fit for untreated yard waste however for pretreated YW logistic function model was the best.

While pretreatment with severities higher than 4 resulted in a highest solubilisation of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin; however, furans concentration in those cases hindered biomass biodegradation. Considering a CHP, all pretreatment conditions were worthwhile when compared to non-pretreated CH. The best condition was 120 degrees C for 60 min, in which a 2.37 severity showed the highest methane yield (144.96 NmL CH4 g COD-1) and electricity production (0.59 kWh kg CH-1).

Effect of calcium peroxide pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of primary and secondary sludge of A(2)/O process,"In order to evaluate comprehensively the impact of calcium peroxide (CP) on anaerobic digestion (AD) of primary sludge (P-sludge) and secondary sludge (S-sludge) of anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic process, a series of batch experiments were conducted in the lab scale. Results showed that CP pretreatment could kill Fecal Coliform completely in 72.0 h and promote the solubilization of S-sludge more significantly than P-sludge. Compared with the control, the maximum CH4 production potential and the maximum specific CH4 production rate of P-sludge AD only increased by 11.2 % and 6.10 %, respectively, but those of S-sludge AD increased by 40.7 % and 58.4 % after the same pretreatment, indicating that CP pretreatment was more conducive to methane production of Ssludge. Moreover, the increase of alkalinity and initial acetate concentration of S-sludge was greater than that of P-sludge after pretreatment according to the process analysis of hydrolysis. Notably, CP pretreatment reduced the PO43-P concentration and chromaticity in the AD supernatant of both sludges, which was beneficial to the subsequent treatment of biogas slurry. In addition, CP pretreatment increased the content of total nutrient and decreased the content of harmful heavy metals in both biogas residues. Conclusively, compared with P-sludge, CP pretreatment is more suitable for S-sludge AD. This work firstly provides a comprehensive evaluation of CP pretreatment to waste sludge produced in anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic process of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), which is of great significance in enriching the pretreatment technology of waste sludge and promoting the application of CP pretreatment in WWTP.","Wang, Z; Wang, Y; Li, X; Chen, Z; Kou, XM; Gao, LJ; Wu, SZ; Chai, BH",Anaerobic digestion; Calcium peroxide pretreatment; Primary sludge; Secondary sludge; Digestate,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jwpe.2022.102994,Chemical,oxidizer,peroxide cao2,activated sludge,mixed sludge,,,,,,,,,
Effect of micro-oxygen pretreatment on gas production characteristics of anaerobic digestion of kitchen waste,"Micro-oxygen pretreatment of kitchen waste was done to improve the gas production efficiency of anaerobic fermentation and shorten the fermentation cycle of kitchen waste. The results demonstrated that with an oxygen supply of 20 mL, the peak gas production increased from 498 to 601 mL, and the theoretical gas production increased by 4.5 mL/g VS (volatiles solid) compared with those of the control group R1-R4. The anaerobic fermentation entered the late stage on day 25, which was 13 days earlier than that of the control group. The chemical oxygen demand and ammonia nitrogen contents in the treatment groups of R1-R4 were relatively stable. An oxygen supply of 20 mL was conducive to stimulating the facultative anaerobes, promoting the decomposition of nitrogenous compounds and organic matter, and improving the anaerobic fermentation efficiency. A lesser amount of oxygen (<= 15 mL) was unable to effectively improve the gas production efficiency of anaerobic fermentation, although it exerted a certain inhibitory effect on anaerobic fermentation.","Zhen, XF; Zhang, XY; Li, SB; Li, MC; Kang, J",Micro-oxygen pretreatment; Kitchen waste; Gas production characteristics; Anaerobic digestion,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10163-020-01072-9,Biological,aerobic,microaerobic,food waste,kitchen waste,,,,,,,,,

The NaOH-pretreated corn stover was digested using effluent of liquid anaerobic digestion as inoculum and nitrogen source. NaOH loading of 1% did not cause significant improvement on biogas yield. The highest biogas yield of 372.4 L/kg VS was obtained with 5% NaOH-pretreated corn stover, which was 37.0% higher than that of the untreated corn stover. However, a higher NaOH loading of 7.5% caused faster production of volatile fatty acids during the hydrolysis and acidogenesis stages, which inhibited the methanogenesis. Simultaneous NaOH treatment and anaerobic digestion did not significantly improve the biogas production (P>0.05). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Destroying lignocellulosic matters for enhancing methane production from excess sludge,"A lot of lignocellulosic matters are usually present in excess sludge, which are hardly degraded in anaerobic digestion (AD) and thus remains mostly in digested sludge. This is a reason why the conversion rate of sludge organics into energy (CH4) is often low. Obviously, the hydrolysis of AD cannot destruct the structure of lignocellulosic matters. Structural destruction of lignocellulosic matters has to be performed in AD. In this study, pretreatments with the same principles as cell disintegration of sludge were applied to destruct lignocellulosic matters so that these materials could be converted to CH4 via AD. Acid, alkali, thermal treatment and ultrasonic were used in the experiments to observe the destructed/degraded efficiency of lignocellulosic matters. Thermal treatment was found to be the most effective pretreatment. Under optimized conditions (T = 150 degrees C and t = 30 min), pretreated sludge had a degraded rate of 52.6% in AD, due to easy destruction and/or degradation of hemicelluloses and celluloses in pretreatment. The sludge pretreated by thermal treatment could enhance the CH4 yield (mL CH4 g(-1) VSS) by 53.6% compared to raw sludge.

The thermophilic (55 degrees C) microaerobic pretreatment of corn straw for anaerobic digestion,"Microaerobic process has been proven to be an alternative pretreatment for the anaerobic digestion (AD) process in several studies. In this study, the effect of thermophilic microaerobic pretreatment (TMP) on the AD of corn straw was investigated. Results indicated that TMP process obviously improved the methane yield. The maximum methane yield was obtained at the oxygen loads of 5 ml/g VSsubstrate, which was 16.24% higher than that of untreated group. The modified first order equation analysis showed the TMP process not only accelerated the hydrolysis rates but also reduced the lag-phase time of AD process. The structural characterization analysis showed cellulosic structures of corn straw were partly disrupted during TMP process. The crystallinity indexes were also decreased. In addition, large or destroyed pores and substantial structural disruption were observed after pretreatment. The results showed that TMP is an efficient pretreatment method for the AD of corn straw.

Feasibility of anaerobic digestion on the release of biogas and heavy metals from rice straw pretreated with sodium hydroxide,"The feasibility of anaerobic digestion on the release of biogas and heavy metals from contaminated rice straw pretreated with NaOH solution was studied. The results show that NaOH pretreatment can significantly boost the release of biogas and heavy metals from rice straw using anaerobic digestion. Under the optimal conditions for biomass pretreated 6% (w/w) NaOH with a solid-to-solution ratio of 1:20, total biogas and methane yields of 446.3 mL/g and 263.5 mL/g volatile solids were achieved, which were 22.18% and 41.59% higher than those of the control without NaOH pretreatment, respectively, and the release percentages of Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn from rice straw reached 86.95-97.69%. The release of heavy metals from rice straw can contribute to both the degradation of lignin by NaOH pretreatment and the utilization/transformation of lignocellulose via anaerobic digestion. The acidification levels and total volatile fatty acid contents significantly influence on the release of heavy metals. Based on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing analysis, the dominant phyla in the biogas residues were proteolytic (Bacteroidetes) and hydrogen-producing (Firmicutes) bacteria, while the growth of Methanospirillum and Methanosaeta in anaerobically digested effluent was promoted.

"Process optimization and effect of thermal, alkaline, H2O2 oxidation and combination pretreatment of sewage sludge on solubilization and anaerobic digestion","Background This study investigated the feasibility of enhancing anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge with triple, dual, and individual pretreatment of waste activated sludge with heat, alkalinity, and hydrogen peroxide. These pretreatments disrupt sludge flocs, organisms' cell walls, extracellular polymeric substance, and intracellular organic matter, which increase biodegradability and hydrolysis rate of activate sludge. In addition, the influence of various variables on methane production was analyzed using the response surface methodology with the quadratic model.

Results The highest amount of methane production was obtained from the sludge pretreated with triple pretreatment (heat (90 degrees C), alkaline (pH = 12), and hydrogen peroxide (30 mg H2O2/g TS)), which had better performance with 96% higher methane production than that of the control sample with temperature of 25 degrees C approximately and a pH = 8.

Anaerobic digestion of tomato processing waste: Effect of alkaline pretreatment,"The objective of the work was to assess the effect of mild alkaline pretreatment on the anaerobic biodegradability of tomato processing waste (TPW). Experiments were carried out in duplicate BMP bottles using a pretreatment contact time of 4 and 24 h and a 1% and 5% NaOH dosage. The cumulative methane production during a 30 d period was recorded and modelled. The alkaline pretreatment did not significantly affect methane production in any of the treatments in comparison to the control. The average methane production for all runs was 320 NmL/gVS. Based on first order kinetic modelling, the alkaline pretreatment was found to slow down the rate of methanogenesis, mainly in the two reactors with the highest NaOH dosage. The biodegradability of the substrates ranged from 0.75 to 0.82 and from 0.66 to 0.72 based on two different approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Results show that both pretreatments can significantly improve the solubilisation of organic solid waste. However, during ozonation experiments, no correlation was observed between increased solubilisation and biogas production: the application of higher ozone doses led to the formation of by-products less biodegradable than untreated substrate.

Enhancing anaerobic digestibility and phosphorus recovery of dairy manure through microwave-based thermochemical pretreatment,"Anaerobic digestion and struvite precipitation are two effective ways of treating dairy manure for recovering biogas and phosphor-us. Anaerobic digestion of dairy manure is commonly limited by slow fiber degradation, while struvite precipitation is limited by the availability of orthophosphate. The aim of this work is to study the possibility of using microwave-based thermochemical pretreatment to simultaneously enhance manure anaerobic digestibility (through fiber degradation) and struvite precipitation (through phosphorus solubilization). Microwave heating combined with different chemicals (NaOH, CaO, H2SO4, or HCl) enhanced solubilization of manure and degradation of glucan/xylan in dairy manure. However, sulfuric acid-based pretreatment resulted in a low anaerobic digestibility, probably due to the sulfur inhibition and Maillard side reaction. The pretreatments released 20-40% soluble phosphorus and 9-14% ammonium. However, CaO-based pretreatment resulted in lower orthophosphate releases and struvite precipitation efficiency as calcium interferes with phosphate to form calcium phosphate. Collectively, microwave heating combined with NaOH or HCl led to a high anaerobic digestibility and phosphorus recovery. Using these two chemicals, the performance of microwave- and conventional-heating in thermochemical pretreatment was further compared. The microwave heating resulted in a better performance in terms of COD solubilization, glucan/xylan reduction, phosphorus solubilization and anaerobic digestibility. Lastly, temperature and heating time used in microwave treatment were optimized. The optimal values of temperature and heating time were 147 degrees C and 25.3 min for methane production, and 135 degrees C and 26 min for orthophosphate release, respectively.

"Combined hydrothermal and free nitrous acid, alkali and acid pretreatment for biomethane recovery from municipal sludge","This study focused on investigating the effect of combined chemical and hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) on the anaerobic digestibility of thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS). Three different combined pretreatment conditions of HTP + free nitrous acid (FNA), HTP + Acid, and HTP + Alkaline were applied to TWAS. To control and compare the effect of combined pretreatments and a single pretreatment, Acid, Alkaline, FNA and HTP pretreatments were applied done prior to AD. The results of this study revealed that combined pretreatments have higher potential to improve methane production yield and rate but not in the solubilization of COD. The highest methane yield of 275 mL CH4/g TCOD added was achieved for the combined pretreatment with FNA and HTP. HTP + FNA pretreatment was found to produce higher methane yields compared to the combination of other typical acid and alkaline reagents with hydrothermal pretreatment. Methane yields of 594, 527, and 544 L CH4/g VSS added, were achieved for HTP + FNA, HTP + ALK, and HTP + ACID pretreatments, respectively. The preliminary economic analysis showed that out of the combined pretreatment, only combining HTP with FNA is economically feasible.","Kakar, FL; Purohit, N; Okoye, F; Liss, SN; Elbeshbishy, E",Anaerobic digestion; Pretreatment; TWAS; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Chemical pretreatment; Combined pretreatment,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.06.021,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,activated sludge,thickened waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,

Improving the methane production from zucchini stem by response surface methodology and different pretreatments,"Each year, about 2.4 million tons of zucchini stem (ZS) are discarded after harvesting of zucchini and result in serious environmental pollutions. This study adopted anaerobic digestion (AD) technology to convert ZS to clean energy and systematically investigated the methane production performance of ZS. For improving AD efficiency, organic loading (OL) and feed to inoculum ratio (F/I ratio) were optimized by response surface methodology (RSM), and various pretreatment techniques including KOH, Ca(OH)(2), NaOH, alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP), HCl and microwave (MW) pretreatment were studied. RSM results showed that OL and F/I ratio had obvious influences on cumulative methane yield (CMY), and the highest CMY of 239.6 mL.g(vs)(-1) was determined at OL of 17.8 g(vs).L-1 and F/I ratio of 0.75. Among all the pretreatments, ZS pretreated with 4% NaOH, 4% AHP, and 2% KOH significantly promoted CMY to 338.3 mL.g(vs)(-1), 277.6 mL.g(vs)(-1), and 266.1 mL.g(vs)(-1), with the biodegradability of 80.39%, 65.96%, and 63.21%, which were 74.91%, 43.52%, and 37.54% higher than raw ZS, respectively. Furthermore, SEM, XRD, and FTIR analyses showed that alkaline pretreated ZS had preferable structural changes. This study not only explores a novel and sustainable AD feedstock and develops an efficient utilization method for ZS in future application but also converts ZS into bio-methane, which can be used instead of fossil fuels for improving energy structure.","Gu, YQ; Cai, FF; Zhu, Z; Dai, ZQ; Chen, C; Liu, GQ",Zucchini stem; Anaerobic digestion; Methane production; Pretreatment; Response surface methodology,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.112402,Chemical,alkaline,"koh,caoh,naoh",lignocellulose,zucchini,stem,7,5.8,39,4,9.71,29,13,7.9

Mechanical Pre-treatments Evaluation of Cattle Manure Before Anaerobic Digestion,"Pre-treatments are often applied in anaerobic digestion in order to improve the performance of the process: increased methane yield and rate. Physical pretreatments are the most commonly used for anaerobic digestion of agricultural waste. The main purpose of this work was to evaluate the effects of different lab-scale mechanical pretreatments on cattle manure. Three mechanical pre-treatments were sequentially applied to cattle manure: shredding, mixing and blending. An original set of analytical procedures was performed before and after mechanical pretreatments, in order to assess physical, chemical and biological properties of the feedstock. Thus, shredding and mixing pre-treatments were not significantly efficient in terms of methane production yield and rate. In contrast, methane production rate increased with blending treatment, and methane yield was slightly improved as well. An increase of soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) was also reported with blending pretreatment. The reduction of particle size was mainly between 31.5 and 4 mm for all pretreatments and it led to an increase of water retention capacity of the cattle manure. Therefore, mechanical pre-treatments do not only affect the biochemical characteristics of agricultural waste. It also influences its structure and reactivity. In this context, blending pretreatment showed as the most performant pretreatment among the evaluated pretreatments with an increase of 18% on methane rate and a higher COD solubilisation.

Biological pretreatment enhances the activity of functional microorganisms and the ability of methanogenesis during anaerobic digestion,"Biological pretreatment can increase the methane production of anaerobic digestion. In this study, stover was pretreated via microbial consortium prior to anaerobic digestion; through 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and metatranscriptomic analysis, and the effects of the pretreatment on the microbial community and critical factors of the increased methane production were studied. Microbial community structure was less affected by the pretreatment, which ensures the stable performance of anaerobic digestion. The methane production increased by 62.85% at the peak phase compared to the untreated stover. The activity of Methanosaeta increased from 2.0% to 10.1%, significantly enhancing the ability of the community to capture acetic acid and reduce CO2 to methane. The main contribution to the increase in methane production was a unique acetyl-CoA synthetase, which showed significant up-regulation (121.8%). This research demonstrated the importance of Methanosaeta and its unique metabolic pathways in anaerobic digestion utilizing a biological pretreatment.","Zhao, YQ; Xu, CF; Ai, SQ; Wang, HP; Gao, YM; Yan, L; Mei, ZL; Wang, W",Biological pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Community structure; Microbial activity; Methanogenic archaea,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.121660,Biological,microbial consortium,,lignocellulose,corn,stover,,,,,,,,
Anaerobic co-digestion of alkali-pretreated submerged macrophytes and acidified food waste for reduction of neutralizing agents,"Alkaline pretreatment for lignocellulosic biomass is beneficial for enhancing the anaerobic digestibility, but the rise of pretreatment cost and the dilution of substrate by the addition of a neutralizing agent and an alkaline solution are significant drawbacks. To solve these problems, utilization of acidified food waste as a co-substrate during anaerobic digestion of alkali-pretreated submerged macrophytes was attempted under various macrophyte to food waste (MF) ratio, and the biochemical interactions between the co-substrates were investigated. The addition of acidified food waste dropped the pH of alkali-pretreated Potamogeton maackianus, which reduced the dosage of neutralizing agent by 50% at MF 1:1. In co-digestion experiment, more CH4 was produced as the dosage of food waste increased. Volatile-solid based and wet-weight-based CH4 yields for MF 1:1 were 37% and 118% higher than those for the alkali-pretreated macrophyte, respectively, because of the high degradability and organic matter content of the food waste. Comparison between the measured and theoretical COD balance of the co-digestion revealed that there is no positive synergistic effect in the CH4 recovery. Instead, the hydrolysis of the co-substrates is inhibited possibly due to the existence of dissolved lignin. Overall, the study demonstrates that anaerobic co-digestion of alkali-pretreated macrophytes and acidified food waste could be a feasible option for reducing the neutralizing agent cost and enhancing the volumetric CH4 yield.

Comparison of the Reactor Performance of Alkaline-Pretreated Corn Stover Co-digested with Dairy Manure Under Solid-State,"Solid-state anaerobic digestion is a promising path to optimize green energy generation from waste management. This mesophilic study investigated the performance of sodium hydroxide (4%NaOH), ammonium hydroxide (2%NH4OH, and 4%NH4OH), and calcium hydroxide (8%Ca(OH)(2)) pretreated corn stover (Cs) co-digested with dairy manure (Dm) to achieve 4%NaCsDm, 2%AqCsDm, 4%AqCsDm, and 8%CaCsDm treatments. Results showed that 8%CaCsDm had shortened detention time (79 days) and increased methane yield (178 L/kg VS) in comparison with other treatments. In addition, propionic acid concentration in treatment 4%NaCsDm was elevated beyond a safe threshold (> 0.9 g/L) for methanogens, which is unlike the significant bioconversion that occurred for other treatments. Though, free ammonia concentration for 2%AqCsDm and 4%AqCsDm pre-digestates were within the safe limit (< 53 mg/L) relative to other treatments, 8%CaCsDm sufficiently reduced the initial inhibitory concentration to a safe threshold at the cessation of the experiment. Additionally, 8%CaCsDm treatment had the highest VFA bioconversion rate (80%). Therefore, this study demonstrated that 8%CaCsDm treatment could effectively improve reactor performance in solid-state anaerobic co-digestion.

Influence of mechanical pretreatment and organic concentration of Irish brown seaweed for methane production,"The European Commission opened a discussion about limiting first generation food based biofuels in favour of advanced biofuels. The main reason was to limit the uncertainty in estimates of indirect land use change emissions (ILUC) of food based biofuels. Brown seaweeds represent a valuable solution. The lack of lignin makes them suitable for degradation processes such as anaerobic digestion (AD). The main output of AD is biogas which can be upgraded to biomethane and used as a transport fuel. The most common Irish brown seaweeds namely Laminaria sp. and Ascophyllum nodosum were subject to AD. The effects of beating pretreatment time (5-10-15 min) and changes in the seaweeds volatile solids (VS) concentration (1-2.5-4%) on methane production were investigated through a response surface methodology (RSM).

"Effect of output power, target temperature, and solid concentration on the solubilization of waste activated sludge using microwave irradiation","In this paper. we quantify the effect of heating pretreatment on the degree of solubilization of waste activated sludge. The pretreatment process was carried Out using a lab-scale industrial microwave unit (2450 MHz frequency). Response surface analysis was applied to determine the combination of output power (400-1600 W), target temperature (60-120 degrees C), and total solid concentration (1-3% total solid (TS)). The power, temperature, and TS concentration significantly affected the solubilization degree of sludge. Within the design boundaries, the conditions predicted to maximize the solubilization degree of 17.9% were determined to be 400 W, 102 degrees C, and 2.3% TS. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Stimulating biogas production from steam-exploded birch wood using Fenton reaction and fungal pretreatment,"Delignification of steam-exploded birch wood (SEBW) was stimulated using a pretreatment method including Fenton reaction (FR) and fungi. SEBW was employed as a substrate to optimize the Fe(III) and Fe(II) dosage in FR. Maximum iron-binding to SEBW was obtained at pH 3.5. FR pretreatment increased biological methane yields from 257 mL/g vS in control to 383 and 352 mL/ g vS in samples with 0.5 mM Fe(II) and 1.0 mM Fe(III), respectively. Further enzymatic pretreatment using a commercial cellulase cocktail clearly improved methane production rate but only increased the final methane yields by 2-9 %. Finally, pretreatments with the fungi Pleurotus ostreatus (PO) and Lentinula edodes (LE), alone or in combination with FR, were carried out. SEBW pretreated with only LE and samples pretreated with PO and1 mM Fe(III) + H2O2 increased the methane production yield to 420 and 419 mL/g vS respectively. These pretreatments delignified SEBW up to 25 %.","Hashemi, S; Solli, L; Aasen, R; Lamb, JJ; Horn, SJ; Lien, KM",Anaerobic digestion; Fenton reaction; Enzymatic pretreatment; White -rot fungi; Lignocellulose,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.128190,Physical,thermal,steam explosion,wood,woodchips,birch,,,,,,,,
Research on the electrochemistry synergied cellulase enzymes strengthens the anaerobic fermentation of cow dung,"Lignocellulose degradation (LCD) was the key factor limiting the development of anaerobic fermentation (AF) by the cow dung (CD). In the research, the effects of cellulase pretreatment (CP) and microvoltage (MV) alone and combination on the gas production and LCD during the AF were investigated. The results showed that both CP and MV had an significant effect on the AF, though the synergistic reaction was more pronounced. The total biogas yield (TBY) could reach 11521 mL, and the highest methane production rate was 73% in the synergistic reactions, which was increased by 18.7% and 10.0% compared to CP and MV alone respectively. Meanwhile, the degradation rates of cellulose and lignin could be increased by 33.44% and 22.23%, respectively. The results of SEM, FT-IR and excitation emission matrix demonstrated that CP and MV played an important role in improving the fermentation efficiency. The microbial biomass change results indicated that the synergistic effect of CP and 0.8 V MV on the LCD was achieved by promoting the growth of lignocellulose-degrading bacteria. Moreover, the electricity could not only accelerate the movement of microorganisms and enzymes, but also promoted and enhanced the activity of enzymes, which provided an important reference for further development of the AF technology and the biogas industry.","Cai, YY; Li, H; Qu, GF; Li, JY; Ren, NQ; Zou, HM; Hu, YH; Zeng, JH",Anaerobic digestion; Biomass analysis; Cellulase pretreatment; Dairy manure; Lignocellulose; Microvoltage,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19802-x,Biological,enzyme,cellulase,manure,cow,,,73,,,,35.5,27,

The total biogas yield (TBY) could reach 11521 mL, and the highest methane production rate was 73% in the synergistic reactions, which was increased by 18.7% and 10.0% compared to CP and MV alone respectively. Meanwhile, the degradation rates of cellulose and lignin could be increased by 33.44% and 22.23%, respectively. The results of SEM, FT-IR and excitation emission matrix demonstrated that CP and MV played an important role in improving the fermentation efficiency. The microbial biomass change results indicated that the synergistic effect of CP and 0.8 V MV on the LCD was achieved by promoting the growth of lignocellulose-degrading bacteria. Moreover, the electricity could not only accelerate the movement of microorganisms and enzymes, but also promoted and enhanced the activity of enzymes, which provided an important reference for further development of the AF technology and the biogas industry.","Cai, YY; Li, H; Qu, GF; Li, JY; Ren, NQ; Zou, HM; Hu, YH; Zeng, JH",Anaerobic digestion; Biomass analysis; Cellulase pretreatment; Dairy manure; Lignocellulose; Microvoltage,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19802-x,Physical,electrolysis,,manure,cow,,,73,,,,35.5,27,
Anaerobic Biodegradation of Wheat Straw Lignin: The Influence of Wet Explosion Pretreatment,"Large amounts of lignin residue is expected in the future when biorefineries for producing biofuels and bio-products will increase in numbers. It is, therefore, valuable to find solutions for using this resource for the sustained production of useful bioenergy or bio-products. Anaerobic digestion could potentially be an option for converting the biorefinery lignin into a valuable energy product. However, lignin is recalcitrant to biodegradation under anaerobic conditions unless the structure is modified. Wet oxidation followed by steam explosion (wet explosion) was previously found to make significant changes to the lignin structure allowing for biodegradation under anaerobic conditions. In this study, we examine the effect of wet explosion pretreatment for anaerobic digestion of wheat straw lignin under mesophilic (37 degrees C) conditions. Besides the biorefinery lignin produced from wheat straw, untreated lignin was further tested as feed material for anaerobic digestion. Our results showed that wet exploded lignin pretreated with 2% NaOH showed the highest lignin degradation (41.8%) as well as the highest methane potential of 157.3 +/- 9.9 mL/g VS. The untreated lignin with no pretreatment showed the lowest methane yield of 65.8 +/- 4.8 and only 3.5% of the lignin was degraded. Overall, increased severity of the pretreatment was found to enhance anaerobic degradation of lignin.","Khan, MU; Ahring, BK",lignocellulosic materials; anaerobic digestion; wet explosion pretreatment; lignin; cellulose; hemicellulose,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14185940,Physical,thermal,wet explosion,lignocellulose,wheat,straw,,,,,,,,
Transformation of dissolved organic matters produced from alkaline-ultrasonic sludge pretreatment in anaerobic digestion: From macro to micro,"Soluble organic compounds released by alkaline (ALK), ultrasonic (ULS) and combined alkaline ultrasonic (ALK-ULS) pretreatment as well as their transformation in the anaerobic digestion systems were investigated. The maximum methane production of 197.1 +/- 3.0 mL CH4/g tCOD(feed) was observed with ALK-ULS pretreated sludge (pH 12 and specific energy input of 24 kJ/g TS). The combined treatment likely enhanced the sludge solubilization and produced more low molecular weight (LMW) substances, which were beneficial to improve the biogas generation rate. However, such pretreatment released not only easily biodegradable substances but also more recalcitrants, such as humic substances (HS) and complex high molecular weight (HMW) proteins. Thus, more residual dissolved organic matters (DOMs) were detected after digestion, which may pose adverse effects on the downstream water treatment. Refractory HS and hydrophobic dissolved organic carbon (HO DOC) were the main components of the residual DOMs, which accounted up to 35.0% and 22.3% respectively. At the molecular level, a large amount of residual polycyclic steroid-like matters, alkanes and aromatics were identified. Specific higher MW residual compounds, e.g. polar metabolites (like dipeptide, benzene and substituted derivatives), and non-polar lipids (like diacylglycerols, long chain fatty acids, alkenes, flavonoids, sphingolipids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids and their derivatives) were also identified. The results indicate that further polishing steps should be considered to remove the remaining soluble recalcitrant compounds.

Protease pretreated Chlorella vulgaris biomass bioconversion to methane via semi-continuous anaerobic digestion,"This study evaluated the enhancement of biogas production in semi-continuous anaerobic digestion fed with enzymatically pretreated Chlorella vulgaris. Organic matter in soluble phase increased from 2.5% to 45% after pretreatment with proteases. The soluble COD was easily biodegradable and almost all organic matter available in soluble phase was removed (94.4%) in the anaerobic reactor (CSTR). Methane yield increased 2.6-fold when compared to the CSTR fed with raw biomass. With regard to the nitrogen fate, 77% of the organic nitrogen was mineralized during anaerobic digestion. Slight ammonium inhibition was detected due to the high nitrogen mineralization registered. pHs remained close to neutrality throughout the experimental time. VFAs were accumulated in the last retention time as a consequence of the slight anaerobic digestion inhibition, which revealed an unbalanced equilibrium among the anaerobic microbial population. This fact was corroborated in batch digestion assays. The anaerobic sludge collected from the CSTR exhibited a different profile in terms of methane productivity when compared to the inoculum from WWTP normally used. Further studies are nowadays undertaken to overcome the inhibition and thus increase the methane yield. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Enhancement of hydrolysis of lignocellulose waste pulp and paper mill sludge through different heating processes on thermal pretreatment,"Different heating processes were applied to pretreat the pulp and paper mill sludge to enhance the hydrolysis stage. Hot air oven, autoclave, microwave and water bath were used for comparison. Chemical analyses exposed that all the pretreatment methods have shown improvement in solubilisation of organic matter. Among the pretreatments studied, heat transfer through hot air (80 degrees C for 90 min) mode had the highest impact on sludge solubilisation. There was an increase in cellulose (P = 0.0096), acid soluble (P = 0.0053) and insoluble lignin (P = 0.0012), but decrease in hemicellulose (P = 0.0009) content after pretreatment. The XRD and FT-IR spectroscopic characterisation shows the development of aliphatic, unsaturated and carbonyl carbon functionalities in the pretreated samples at higher severities. FESEM picture also confirms the change in structure after pretreatment. Thus, pretreatments contribute to disruption of the lignocellulosic structure making the cellulose easily accessible to acidogenic microorganisms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Impact of co-pretreatment of calcium hydroxide and steam explosion on anaerobic digestion efficiency with corn stover,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) is an effective way to utilize the abundant resource of corn stover (CS).

Why can hydrothermally pretreating lignocellulose in low severities improve anaerobic digestion performances?,"A lignocellulosic residue, rice straw, was hydrothermally pretreated for the whole slurry anaerobic digestion. In contrast to the unpretreated rice straw, 110-120 degrees C pretreatment promoted biogas yield by 35%-38%, while only 14% promotion happened on the pretreatment at 180 degrees C. To understand why this improvement happened at lower severities, the pretreated rice straw at 90 degrees C, 120 degrees C, and 180 degrees C were selected for the further investigation, in which the liquor and solid fraction were separated for digestion, and compared with the whole slurry digestion. Results indicated more methane was released from the derived liquor of 180 degrees C than that of 90 degrees C and 120 degrees C, however, solid fraction did not exhibit significantly different methane yields (187.77-193.91 mL/g TS). These results suggested that the released soluble fraction from pretreatment could facilitate the methanogenesis. Furthermore, the released inherent soluble fraction in rice straw was mainly responsible for higher biogas yield at lower temperatures. Pretreatment at higher temperatures disintegrated the rice straw recalcitrance more, and intensified the release of soluble fraction accordingly. Consequently, the methanogenesis of whole slurry could be promoted at the initial digestion; the hydrolysis/acidification of the solid fraction in whole slurry was weakened greatly, which resulted in a lower biogas yield. This can also be proved by the evolution of dominant bacteria and archaea in the anaerobic digestion of whole slurry, separated solid and liquor fraction. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of mechanical pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion of Hybrid Pennisetum,"This study investigated the effect of particle size on the performance of anaerobic digestion of Hybrid Pennisetum. Hybrid Pennisetum was ground and sieved to provide different particle sizes between 0.180 and 1.000 mm. Characterization of the different particle sizes suggested that the composition of ground Hybrid Pennisetum Wltered-carbohydrate content decreased and lignin content increased with a decrease in particle size. The highest specific methane yield was 291.9 +/- 4.7 mL CH4.g(-1) VS at a particle size of 0.250-0.380mm and this value plateaued as the particle size was reduced to below 0.250 mm. Excessive size reduction did not improve the methane yield but did result in a reduction of digestion time by 28.6-35.7%. The net energy output from the process was calculated at 300 kWh/t VS. Therefore, grinding was proved to enhance the anaerobic fermentation efficiency and energy output of Hybrid Pennisetum.","Kang, XH; Zhang, Y; Song, B; Sun, YM; Li, LH; He, Y; Kong, XY; Luo, XJ; Yuan, ZH",Hybrid Pennisetum; Biomass; Anaerobic digestion; Methane; Mechanical pretreatment; Particle size,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2019.04.134,Physical,mechanical desintegration,grinding+sieving,lignocellulose,Pennisetum,plant,29,26,,,,,,
"Improved methane production from waste activated sludge by combining free ammonia with heat pretreatment: Performance, mechanisms and applications","Anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge (WAS) is often limited by low hydrolysis efficiencies and poor methane potentials. This work presents a novel pretreatment technology for WAS anaerobic digestion, i.e., combining free ammonia with heat pretreatment (CFHP). Experimental results showed that compared with control, solo free ammonia (135.4 mg NH3-N/L) and solo heat (70 degrees C) pretreatment, the combined free ammonia and heat (135.4 mg NH3-N/L with 70 degrees C) obtained 52.2%, 25.5% and 30.2% faster in hydrolysis rate and 25.2%, 17.9% and 16.5% higher in biochemical methane potential, respectively. Mechanism investigations showed that the combined pretreatment not only largely facilitated the disintegration of WAS but also increased the proportion of biodegradable organic matters, thereby providing better contract between biodegradable organics and the anaerobic microbes for methane production.

HPRS-210 yielded 208.5 mL/g TS biogas, which was 30% reduction with longer lag period of 19.8 d, suggesting serious inhibitions happened. Through slightly increasing organic loading, more serious acidification and reduction on biogas yield, especially at higher pretreatment temperatures, indicated the soluble fractions controlled digestion performances. Pearson correlation analysis suggested negative relationship existed between methane yield and the soluble fractions including soluble carbohydrates, formic acid and furfural.

In the present study, aqueous ammonia soaking (AAS) was investigated as a pretreatment method to increase methane potential of swine manure fibers. 3 days at 22 degrees C were the optimal conditions among the ones tested (1, 3, and 5 days at 22 and 55 degrees C) for increasing the methane potential of manure fibers. AAS pretreatment exhibited a significant effect on methane production rate and potential. It was found that MS for 3 days at 22 degrees C resulted at a 30-80% and 178% increase in methane yield from digested and raw manure fibers, respectively. Batch anaerobic digestion of MS-treated digested manure fibers could stand loadings as high as 100 g TS/l inoculum with no inhibition problems. Enzymatic hydrolysis tests applied to MS-pretreated fibers resulted to 80% and 65% hydrolysis efficiency of glucan and xylan compared to insignificant numbers for non-pretreated fibers confirming thus that AAS effect on methane yield and production rate is due to the facilitation of hydrolysis step of anaerobic digestion process. This is attributed to AAS directly affecting the disintegration step and thus releasing carbohydrates, which can be further hydrolyzed, from the lignocellulosic matrix. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Sodium hydroxide pretreatment of ensiled sorghum forage and wheat straw to increase methane production,"The aim of this study was to determine the effect of sodium hydroxide pretreatment on the chemical composition and the methane production of ensiled sorghum forage and wheat straw. NaOH pretreatment was conducted in closed bottles, at 40 degrees C for 24 h. Samples were soaked in a NaOH solution at different dosages (expressed in terms of total solids (TS) content) of 1 and 10% gNaOH/gTS, with a TS concentration of 160 gTS/L. At the highest NaOH dosage the reduction of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin was 31, 66 and 44%, and 13, 45 and 3% for sorghum and wheat straw, respectively. The concentration of soluble chemical oxygen demand (CODs) in the liquid phase after the pretreatment was also improved both for wheat straw and sorghum (up to 24 and 33%, respectively). Total sugars content increased up to five times at 10% gNaOH/gTS with respect to control samples, suggesting that NaOH pretreatment improves the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicelluloses. The Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP) tests showed that the NaOH pretreatment favoured the anaerobic degradability of both substrates. At 1 and 10% NaOH dosages, the methane production increased from 14 to 31% for ensiled sorghum forage and from 17 to 47% for wheat straw.

Process performance and change in sludge characteristics during anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge with ozonation,"A new process configuration combining anaerobic digestion with ozonation, and operated at long SRT, was studied with the objective of on-site reduction in sludge quantity and improving biogas recovery. The process performance with respect to solid reduction efficiency and other important process parameters like accumulation of inorganic solids, changes in sludge viscosity and dewatering characteristics were evaluated from the data of long term pilot scale continuous experiments conducted using a mixture of primary and secondary municipal sewage sludge. Due to sludge ozonation and long SRT, high VSS degradation efficiency of approximately 80% was achieved at a reactor solid concentration of 6.5%. A high fraction of inorganic solid (>50%) consisting mainly of acid insoluble and iron compounds was found to accumulate in the reactor. The high inorganic content accumulated in the digested sludge did not, however, contribute to the observed increase in sludge viscosity at high solid concentration, The sludge viscosity was largely found to depend on the organic solid concentration rather than the total solid content. Moreover, higher inorganic,content in the digested sludge resulted in better sludge dewaterability. For a quick assessment of the economic feasibility of the new process an economic index based on the unit cost of digested sludge disposal to unit electric cost is proposed.","Goel, R; Komatsu, K; Yasui, H; Harada, H",anaerobic digestion; dewatering; inorganic; ozone; pretreatment; sludge hydrolysis; solubilization; viscosity,2004,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2004.0620,Chemical,oxidizer,ozone,activated sludge,mixed sludge,,4,2.5,,,,,,
Influence of aerobic pretreatment with Penicillium decumbens on the anaerobic digestion of beet molasses alcoholic fermentation wastewater in suspended and immobilized cell bioreactors,"A comparative study was carried out on the anaerobic digestion of untreated and previously-fermented (with Penicillium decumbens) beet molasses. Four continuous stirred tank reactors were used for the study, two with freely suspended biomass, and the other with biomass supported on saponite. The reactors operated satisfactorily between hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 53.3-10.6 days and 15.4-3.1 days for untreated and previously-fermented molasses respectively. The anaerobic digestion processes of untreated and pretreated molasses were found to follow first-order kinetics for biomass loading rates in the range of 0-0.55 and 0-0.75 g chemical oxygen demand (GOD) g(-1) volatile suspended solids (VSS) day(-1) respectively. The experimental data [namely unitary conversion or efficiency (X), HRT, biomass concentration (M) and incoming substrate concentration (S-0)] conformed to an equation of the form: X/HRT = KM(1 - X)-(KMSR/S-0), from which the kinetic constant, K, was calculated. The kinetic constants were influenced by the pretreatment carried out and were 1.7 and 2.5 times higher for pretreated molasses than for untreated molasses in the reactors with suspended and immobilized biomass respectively. This was significant at a 95% confidence level. The specific rate of substrate uptake for cell maintenance (m) decreased by a factor of approximately 2 for the previously fermented molasses in relation to the observed values for the untreated molasses. This may be attributable to the fact that higher phenolic compound concentrations inhibit and interfere with the activity of anaerobic bacteria.","Jimenez, AM; Borja, R; Alonso, V; Martin, A",kinetic model; anaerobic digestion; best molasses; aerobic pretreatment; Penicillium decumbens,1997,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4660(199706)69:2<193::AID-JCTB707>3.0.CO;2-A,Biological,fungi,Penicillium decumbens,food industry organic waste,sugar beet,molasse,,,,,,,,
Potassium ferrate coupled with freezing method enhances methane production from sludge anaerobic digestion,"This study proposed a novel sludge pretreatment technology by combining freezing with potassium ferrate (PF) for synergistically enhancing the methane yield from sludge anaerobic digestion. Experimental results showed that the methane production was promoted from 170.1 ? 5.6 to 223.8 ? 7.0 mL/g VSS (volatile suspended solids) when pretreated by freezing coupled with 0.05 g/g TSS (total suspended solids) PF, with 31.6% increase. Kinetic model analysis indicated that the methane production potential and hydrolysis rate of sludge after combined pretreatment were enhanced by 32.0% and 15.0%, respectively. Mechanism studies revealed that freezing coupled with PF pretreatment effectively disrupted both extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and microbial cells in sludge, consequently resulted in violent sludge disintegration. All the microbes responsible for hydrolysis, acidification and methanogenesis were found to be enriched by co-treatment of freezing and PF. Moreover, the fecal coliform in pretreated sludge was largely inactivated after anaerobic digestion.","Hu, JW; Li, Z; Wu, ZG; Tao, WQ",Waste activated sludge; Anaerobic digestion; Methane; Potassium ferrate; Freezing pretreatment,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.125112,Chemical,oxidizer,K2FeO4,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,

Effect of Liquid Hot Water Pretreatment on Hydrolysates Composition and Methane Yield of Rice Processing Residue,"Lignocellulosic rice processing residue was pretreated in liquid hot water (LHW) at three different temperatures (140, 160, and 180 degrees C) and two pretreatment times (10 and 20 min) in order to assess its effects on hydrolysates composition, matrix structural changes and methane yield. The concentrations of acetic acid, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural increased with pretreatment severity (log Ro). The maximum methane yield (276 L kg(-1) VS) was achieved under pretreatment conditions of 180 degrees C for 20 min, with a 63% increase compared to untreated biomass. Structural changes resulted in a slight removal of silica on the upper portion of rice husks, visible predominantly at maximum severity. However, the outer epidermis was kept well organized. The results indicate, at severities 2.48 <= log Ro <= 3.66, a significant potential for the use of LHW to improve methane production from rice processing residue.","Gonzalez, LML; Heiermann, M",anaerobic digestion; liquid hot water pretreatment; hydrothermal pretreatment; lignocellulose; silica,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14113254,Physical,thermal,liquid hot water,lignocellulose,rice,waste,94,61,34,1.26,27,19,18,7
"Two-Step Pretreatment of Hydrothermal with Ammonia for Cow Bedding: Pretreatment Characteristics, Anaerobic Digestion Performance and Kinetic Analysis","Cow bedding is one of the dominant livestock wastes among agricultural waste in China.

Obtaining Multiple Coproducts from Red Grape Pomace via Anthocyanin Extraction and Biogas Production,"Red grape pomace (RGP), a byproduct of red wine production, is an abundant food processing waste stream in California, rich in both anthocyanins, a class of red-blue pigments, and lignocellulose. Extraction of anthocyanins and biofuel production from RGP have been investigated independently, but no research has examined employing both strategies together for maximal valorization. In this study, anthocyanins were most effectively extracted from RGP at 80 degrees C. Convection- and vacuum-oven drying of the pomace were found to decrease anthocyanin yield, whereas lyophilization did not significantly affect yield. Fermentable sugars were successfully separated from the crude extract via solid-phase extraction. Ionic liquid pretreatment of RGP was determined to be a nonviable option for application to anaerobic digestion. Extraction reduced biomethane output, but supplementation with the aqueous fraction of the extract mitigated much of this difference, indicating sequential extraction and fractionation of anthocyanins from RGP can minimize the impact on biofuel yields.","Allison, BJ; Simmons, CW",red grape pomace; anaerobic digestion; anthocyanins; extraction; pretreatment; ionic liquids,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b02250,Chemical,solvent,ionic liquid,lignocellulose,grape,pomace,,,,,,,,
Effect of combined mechanical-ultrasonic pretreatment on mesophilic anaerobic digestion of household organic waste fraction in Morocco,"Methanization is a technology that involves complex biological reactions and it is the subject of several scientific studies.

Effects of pretreatments on anaerobic digestion performances in batch reactor for pig mortality and microbial consortia management,"Thermophilic anaerobic digestion (AD) coupled with the pretreatment was used as an alternative method for animal by-product disposal and energy recovery. In this study, the results showed that the cumulative biogas production in T121 thermal pretreatments was slightly lower than that in the Control, while there were no significant differences in the methane content produced between the treatments. Pretreatments with H2SO4 at all different concentrations inhibited the anaerobic digestion with lower biogas and methane production due to the high contents of total volatile fatty acids accumulated in the systems. High throughput sequencing analysis showed that pretreatments affected the diversity, community structure and composition of microbial consortia. However, all these treatments harboured the same dominant phylum (Firmicutes) and genus (Coprothermobacter) with active roles during the AD process. These results also suggested that different pretreatments could form their distinct methanogen pathways. Of the treatments, T121 pretreatment increased the relative abundance of methane-producing archaea. The abundance of Methanosarcina was dominated in the thermal pretreatments, suggesting the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway of methane produced in thermal pretreatments. The abundances of Methanosarcina and Methanothermobacter were nearly the same in the Control and HS4 treatments respectively, indicating that both hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic methanogen pathways were involved in the HS4 and control treatments.

Biochemical Methane Potential Tests to Evaluate Anaerobic Digestion Enhancement by Thermal Hydrolysis Pretreatment,"This study evaluates the effects of thermal hydrolysis (TH) pretreatment on anaerobic digestion (AD), through results obtained by biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests under mesophilic conditions (35 degrees C). Thickened sludge from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was thermally treated under two different temperatures (150 and 170 degrees C) and reaction times (30 and 60 min). Results show a significant increase in soluble COD, compared with the untreated sludge, when sludge was treated at 170 degrees C for 60 min. Moreover, the following BMP tests point out that TH pretreatment of sludge accelerated the AD rate and increased the biogas yield contributing to an increase in methane production, ranging between 17 and 24% compared with the raw sludge. Furthermore, the hydrolysis constant was estimated and methane production and degree of disintegration of the TH pretreated sludge were correlated, in order to deep the knowledge on the hydrolysis as the AD rate-limiting step. Further, the combined effects of TH pretreatment and AD on sludge show a reduction of total and volatile solids up to 19% and 24%, respectively.","Ferrentino, R; Merzari, F; Fiori, L; Andreottola, G",Thermal hydrolysis pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Organic solubilization; BMP; Sludge hydrolysis,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-019-10017-6,Physical,thermal,,activated sludge,thickend sludge,,5,3.7,,,,,,
Optimisation of Microwave Pretreatment for Biogas Enhancement through Anaerobic Digestion of Microalgal Biomass,"In this study, optimization of microwave (MW) pretreatment conditions for anaerobic digestion of green microalgae (Enteromorpha) is carried out by using response surface methodology (RSM). MW power, pretreatment time and liquid-solid ratio were selected as independent variables for optimization. The optimum conditions were achieved at MW power, pretreatment time and liquid-solid ratio of 656.92 W, 5.10 min and 33.63:1, respectively. From these optimum conditions, it was found that MW pretreatment power of about 600 W had better effect. An anaerobic digestion was carried out batch-wise with working volume, operating temperature and mixing rate as 250 ml, 37 degrees C and 150 rpm, respectively. Optimum conditions provide highest amount of COD and reducing sugar increase of 10,420 mg/L and 0.77-0.79 g/L respectively. The increase in COD and reducing sugar showed that the pretreatment has improved anaerobic digestion of microalgae.

The biodegradability of the penicillin bacterial residue was evaluated by biochemical methane potential tests in laboratory. The optimum values of temperature, alkali concentration, pretreatment time and moisture content for the thermal-alkaline pretreatment were determined as 70 degrees C, 6% (w/v), 30 min, and 85%, respectively. Thermal-alkaline pretreatment could significantly enhance the soluble chemical oxygen demand solubilization, the suspended solid solubilization and the biodegradability. Biogas production was enhanced by the thermal-alkaline pretreatment, probably as a result of the breakdown of cell walls and membranes of micro-organisms, which may facilitate the contact between organic molecules and anaerobic microorganisms.","Zhong, WZ; Li, GX; Gao, Y; Li, ZX; Geng, XL; Li, YB; Yang, JL; Zhou, CH",anaerobic digestion; penicillin bacterial residue; biochemical methane potential tests; pretreatment,2015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2015.1021277,Physical,thermal,,other,penicillin bacterial residue,,20,18,,,,,,

Pretreatment of waste activated sludge by peracetic acid oxidation for enhanced anaerobic digestion,"This article studied the sludge reduction and supernatant changes during peracetic acid (PAA) oxidation and investigated subsequent anaerobic biodegradation. PAA oxidation treatment effectively leads to a disintegration of sewage sludge. The results suggested that the sludge solid concentration and volatile solid concentration decreased by 24.5 and 39.0% after 120 min, respectively, when the PAA dose was 30 mg PAA/g SS. The VSS to SS ratio dropped from 0.85 to 0.71. The concentration of supernatant soluble chemical oxygen demand, protein, total phosphorus, polysaccharide, and ammonia nitrogen increased by 530, 177, 166, 165, and 222%, respectively. Biogas production was enhanced when PAA was employed as a pretreatment. Compared with the control system, the cumulative biogas production increased by 20.0% after 28 days of anaerobic digestion (AD). The biogas production rate in digester with pretreated sludge reached the maximum on day 8 at 87mL/d, but the peak value was obtained on day 11 at 74mL/d in digester with the raw sludge, which indicated that PAA pretreatment could decrease the retention time of AD and increase biogas yield.

Pretreatment of Chicken Feather Waste for Improved Biogas Production,"This study deals with the utilization of chicken feather waste as a substrate for anaerobic digestion and improving biogas production by degradation of the compact structure of the feather keratin. In order to increase the digestibility of the feather, different pretreatments were investigated, including thermal pretreatment at 120 A degrees C for 10 min, enzymatic hydrolysis with an alkaline endopeptidase [0.53-2.66 mL/g volatile solids (VS) feathers] for 0, 2, or 24 h at 55 A degrees C, as well as a combination of these pretreatments. The effects of the treatments were then evaluated by anaerobic batch digestion assays at 55 A degrees C. The enzymatic pretreatment increased the methane yield to 0.40 Nm(3)/kg VSadded, which is 122 % improvement compared to the yield of the untreated feathers. The other treatment conditions were less effective, increasing the methane yield by 11-50 %. The long-term effects of anaerobic digestion of feathers were examined by co-digestion of the feather with organic fraction of municipal solid waste performed with and without the addition of enzyme. When enzyme was added together with the feed, CH4 yield of 0.485 Nm(3)/kg VS-1 d(-1) was achieved together with a stable reactor performance, while in the control reactor, a decrease in methane production, together with accumulation of undegraded feather, was observed.","Forgacs, G; Lundin, M; Taherzadeh, MJ; Horvath, IS",Anaerobic digestion; Feather waste; Pretreatment; Municipal solid waste; Co-digestion,2013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-013-0116-3,Physical,thermal,,other,chicken feather,,,,,,,,,

"Hydrothermal pretreatment: An efficient process for improvement of biobutanol, biohydrogen, and biogas production from orange waste via a biorefinery approach","Orange waste (OW), an abundant and severe globally environmental treat, was used for biobutanol and biohydrogen production emploing acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation through a biorefinery process. The solvent yield from untreated OW was insufficient; thus, the substrate was subjected to hydrothermal pretreatment before hydrolysis. The pretreatment at 140 degrees C for 30 min resulted in the solid with the highest yield of hydrolysis and fermentation. Moreover, the anaerobic digestion of hydrolysis residue produced appreciable amounts of biomethane. However, the pretreatment liquor was not fermentable; thus, it was detoxified by overliming for 24 h at 30 degrees C and then fermented. Overall, this sustainable biorefinery, based on pretreatment without any additional chemical agent, hydrolysis of pretreated solids, detoxification of pretreatment liquor, ABE fermentation, and anaerobic digestion of residues, produced 42.3 g biobutanol, 33.1 g acetone, 13.4 g ethanol, 104.5 L biohydrogen, and 28.3 L biomethane per kg of OW that contained 4560 kJ energy.","Saadatinavaz, F; Karimi, K; Denayer, JFM",ABE fermentation; Anaerobic digestion; Sustainable biorefinery; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Orange waste,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.125834,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,lignocellulose,orange,fruit waste,,,,,,,,
Hydrothermal pretreatment of sewage sludge for enhanced anaerobic digestion: Resource transformation and energy balance,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) at 90, 125 and 155 degrees C on the extent of anaerobic digestion (AD) of sewage sludge, energy balance, and the distribution and availability of N and P. AD was evaluated with four bench-scale mesophilic, semi-continuous digesters with 20-d (Phase 1) and 10-d (Phase 2) solids retention time (SRT), fed with raw sludge (R1), 90 degrees C (R2), 125 degrees C (R3) and 155 degrees C (R4) HTP sludge. The two sludge mixtures used in this study had high ultimate biodegradability (58.3 for Phase 1 and 56.9% for Phase 2). With the exception of Phase 2 R4, HTP increased organic matter destruction and methane production. HTP of Phase 2 sludge mixture at 155 degrees C resulted in the formation of high propionate levels, which led to a lower methane production. HTP significantly changed the digesters' bacterial communities, but had a minor effect on the archaeal communities. Abundance of well-known propionate degraders in all digesters was very low; however, Proteiniphilum, which is involved in the degradation of intermediates in the propionate degradation pathway, was found in relatively high abundance in Phase 2 R4. The highest net energy gain (Delta E) was obtained with the control (i.e., raw sludge AD without HTP) for both phases. HTP heat recovery greater than 85% is required to attain the same net energy as the control or higher. HTP at 155 degrees C followed by AD led to increased solids reduction, overall crude protein removal and release of ammonium N. HTP-AD decreased P availability. Thus, P and N recovery is recommended before and after HTP-AD, respectively.","Liu, XG; Wang, Q; Tang, YZ; Pavlostathis, SG",Hydrothermal pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Propionate degradation; Nutrient recovery; Energy balance,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2020.127430,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,activated sludge,thickened waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Enhancement of anaerobic digestion of phoenix tree leaf by mild alkali pretreatment: Optimization by Taguchi orthogonal design and semi-continuous operation,"This study aimed at evaluating the valorization of a typical yard waste, phoenix tree leaf (PTL), through mild alkali pretreatment followed by anaerobic digestion (AD). To this end, L9 Taguchi orthogonal biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests and semi-continuous AD experiments were conducted to examine the optimum pretreatment condition and the long term effect of alkali pretreatment on AD. The community structure evo-lutions were analyzed by high throughput 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. The results indicated that alkali pretreatment was effective on decrystallization and releasing more surface of PTL for enzyme attacking. The methane yield was positively correlated with lignin removal (R-2=0.8242). In semi-continuous mode, 151.5 +/- 7.9 mL/g VS of the methane yield was obtained for alkali pretreated PTL, which was 80% higher than that of untreated one. Microbial community analysis indicated that alkali pretreatment led to a higher abun-dance of dominated bacteria (Bacteroidetes and Clostridia) and archaea of Methanosaeta.","Mu, L; Zhang, L; Ma, J; Zhu, KY; Chen, CS; Li, AM",Alkali pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Phoenix tree leaf; Taguchi orthogonal design,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.123634,Chemical,alkaline,,lignocellulose,phoenix,leaves,,,,,,,,
Enhancement of anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge by chemical pretreatment,"In this study, the effects of alkaline (pH 10) and acidic (pH 2-5) chemical pretreatment on dissolution of organic matters and biochemical methane potential (BMP) at waste activated sludge (WAS).

In the first step, the feasibility of chemical pretreatment in anaerobic digestion was investigated. Increases in soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD)/total chemical oxygen demand (tCOD) were determined in all chemical pretreatments. In the second step, the sCOD/tCOD ratio was used to determine the effects on the pretreatment and BMP assay was used to examine the enhanced anaerobic digestion. The pretreatment study conditions were determined due to the highest sCOD/tCOD ratios. These highest ratios were obtained at different pH values, operational times and temperatures. The highest cumulative BMP values were taken at pH 10, 10 min, 60 degrees C and pH 5, 15 min, 40 degrees C.

A sustainable biorefinery approach for efficient conversion of aquatic weeds into bioethanol and biomethane,"The study outlines an economical biorefinery concept to evaluate the potential of three aquatic weeds Eichhornia crassipes, Lemna minor and Azolla microphylla for co-production of ethanol and methane. Four different scenarios were investigated viz., scenario A-hydrothermal treatment followed by anaerobic digestion and ethanol fermentation respectively (HT -> AD -> EF), scenario B- thermochemical treatment followed by anaerobic digestion and ethanol fermentation respectively (TC -> AD -> EF), scenario C- hydrothermal treatment followed by ethanol fermentation and anaerobic digestion respectively (HT -> EF -> AD) and scenario D- thermochemical treatment followed by ethanol fermentation and anaerobic digestion respectively (TC -> EF -> AD). Sequential hydro thermal treatment and anaerobic digestion (HT -> AD) in scenario A enhanced the hemicellulose removal by 68.5-73.5% and simultaneously enriched the cellulose content by 41.2-54.5%. This contributed to highest ethanol yield (0.167-0.231 g/g biomass) in scenario A, which was found comparable to that obtained in scenario D, wherein harsh and expensive thermochemical pretreatment was employed. Besides that, relatively higher methane yield of 209-257 dm(3)/kg TOCR (Total organic carbon removal) obtained in scenario A as compared to other scenarios (67.5-238 dm(3)/kg TOCR) improved the overall energy efficiency of the studied concept. The energetic assessment showed lowest total energy output (859.6-1322.7 kwh) in scenario B and C as compared to other scenarios (1041.8-1583.9 kwh), thereby confirming their incompetence in coupled bioenergy production.

Volatile Fatty Acids and Biomethane Recovery from Thickened Waste Activated Sludge: Hydrothermal Pretreatment's Retention Time Impact,"The main objective of this study was to evaluate the hydrothermal pretreatment's retention time influence on the volatile fatty acids and biomethane production from thickened waste activated sludge under mesophilic conditions. Six different retention times of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 min were investigated while the hydrothermal pretreatment temperature was kept at 170 degrees C. The results showed that the chemical oxygen demand (COD) solubilization increased by increasing the hydrothermal pretreatment retention time up to 30 min and stabilized afterwards. The highest COD solubilization of 48% was observed for the sample pretreated at 170 degrees C for 30 min. Similarly, the sample pretreated at 170 degrees C for 30 min demonstrated the highest volatile fatty acids yield of 14.5 g COD/L-substrate added and a methane yield of 225 mL CH4/g TCODadded compared to 4.3 g COD/L-substrate added and 163 mL CH4/g TCODadded for the raw sample, respectively.

Comparison of the near-infrared spectra of hyacinth pretreated by microwave irradiation and water-heating pretreatment revealed that no new compounds were generated during hyacinth pretreatment by microwave irradiation. Atomic force microscopy observations indicated that the physical structures of hyacinth were disrupted by microwave pretreatment. The yield of methane per gram of the microwave-irradiated substrate increased by 38.3% as compared to that of the substrate pretreated via water-heating.

A maximum methane production rate of 0.76 mL.h(-1).g-sub(-1) was obtained by applying PSC = 9.5 g.L-1 and PT = 11 min. Interactive item coefficient analysis showed that methane production was dependent on the PSC and PT, separately, whereas the interactive effect of the PSC and PT on methane production was not significant. The same trend was also observed for the methane production rate.

"Effect of thermal, chemical and thermo-chemical pre-treatments to enhance methane production","The rise in oil price triggered the exploration and enhancement of various renewable energy sources. Producing biogas from organic waste is not only providing a clean sustainable indigenous fuel to the number of on-farm digesters in Europe, but also reducing the ecological and environmental deterioration. The lignocellulosic substrates are not completely biodegraded in anaerobic digesters operating at commercial scale due to their complex physical and chemical structure, which result in meager energy recovery in terms of methane yield. The focus of this study is to investigate the effect of pre-treatments: thermal, thermo-chemical and chemical pre-treatments on the biogas and methane potential of dewatered pig manure. A laboratory scale batch digester is used for these pre-treatments at different temperature range (25 degrees C-150 degrees C). Results showed that thermo-chemical pretreatment has high effect on biogas and methane potential in the temperature range (25-100 degrees C). Maximum enhancement is observed at 70 degrees C with increase of 78% biogas and 60% methane production. Thermal pretreatment also showed enhancement in the temperature range (50-10 degrees C), with maximum enhancement at 100 degrees C having 28% biogas and 25% methane increase.

Improvement of sewage sludge anaerobic digestion through synergistic effect combined trace elements enhancer with enzyme pretreatment and microbial community response,"In this study, a double E strategy (enzymes and enhancer) characterized by high efficiency for enhancing sewage sludge anaerobic digestion (AD) is proposed. This strategy combines addition of trace elements (TEs) enhancer and enzyme pretreatment, inducing a synergistic effect on AD, and it is more effective and economical compared with TEs addition or enzyme pretreatment in isolation. When adding 400 U/g cocktail enzymes and 1.24% trance elements enhancers, the cumulative methane production and the maximum daily methane increased yield by 45.29% and 84.7%, respectively.

Accelerated biomethane production from lignocellulosic biomass: Pretreated by mixed enzymes secreted by Trichoderma viride and Aspergillus sp.,"Biological pretreatment is a promising technology to increase biogas yield. The methane yield and microbial community resulting from anaerobic digestion of maize straw after pretreatment of enzymes [extracted from Trichoderma viride (ETv) and Aspergillus sp. (EAs)] at different mixing ratios [5/0, 4/1, 3/2, 2/3, 1/4, 0/5] were evaluated. The methane yields from mixed enzymes pretreatment were higher than single enzymes pretreatments of ETv and EAs. The optimal enzymes mixing ratio of ETv and EAs was found to be 2/3, with the cumulative methane yield 512.64 mL/g TSadded, which was 31.74% higher than the control. Enzymatic pretreatment promoted an increase in the abundance of bacteria and archaea associated with cellulose decomposition. The majority of bacteria and archaea were assigned to Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Methanosaeta.","Zhao, XL; Zheng, ZH; Cai, YF; Zhao, YB; Zhang, Y; Gao, YH; Cui, ZJ; Wang, XF",Trichoderma viride; Aspergillus sp.; Enzymatic pretreatment; Maize straw; Anaerobic digestion,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.123378,Biological,enzyme,trichoderma viride+ Aspergillus,lignocellulose,corn,straw,93,91,,,,28,28,3.7
Effect of Different Sugar Beet Pulp Pretreatments on Biogas Production Efficiency,"The objective of this study was to determine the effect of different sugar beet pulp (SBP) pretreatments on biogas yield from anaerobic digestion. SBP was subjected to grinding, thermal-pressure processing, enzymatic hydrolysis, or combination of these pretreatments. It was observed that grinding of SBP to 2.5-mm particles resulted in the cumulative biogas productivity of 617.2 mL/g volatile solids (VS), which was 20.2 % higher compared to the biogas yield from the not pretreated SBP, and comparable to that from not ground, enzymatically hydrolyzed SBP. The highest cumulative biogas productivity, 898.7 mL/g VS, was obtained from the ground, thermal-pressure pretreated and enzymatically hydrolyzed SBP. The latter pretreatment variant enabled to achieve the highest glucose concentration (24.765 mg/mL) in the enzymatic hydrolysates. The analysis of energy balance showed that the increase in the number of SBP pretreatment operations significantly reduced the gain of electric energy.","Zieminski, K; Kowalska-Wentel, M",Anaerobic digestion; Grinding; Thermal-pressure pretreatment; Enzymatic hydrolysis; Gompertz model,2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-016-2279-1,Physical,mechanical desintegration,grinding,lignocellulose,sugar beet,pulp,25.6,24.192,,,,29.5,27.5,3.8

Mechanisms of microwave irradiation pretreatment for enhancing anaerobic digestion of cattail by rumen microorganisms,"In this study, the mechanisms of anaerobic digestibility of cattail improved by microwave irradiation pretreatment were explored. Both Box-Behnken design and response surface methodology (RSM) were used to optimize the microwave irradiation pretreatment with regard to chemical oxygen demand equivalent of the products formed in the anaerobic digestion. The optimum products obtained was as follows: substrate loading of 17.0 g volatile solids/L, microwave intensity of 500 W, and irradiation time of 14.0 min. The product formation rate increased by 32% and product yield by 19% after microwave irradiation pretreatment at 100 degrees C, as compared with the conventional water-heating pretreatment under the same conditions. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that the crystallinity index of cattail was reduced by 9.4% with the microwave irradiation, compared with the conventional heating pretreatment. The atomic force microscope analysis further confirmed that the recalcitrant structure of wax and lignin covering on the cattail surface was disrupted by microwave irradiation. These results demonstrate that the breakdown of the crystalline and physical structure of cattail caused by microwave irradiation pretreatment improved its anaerobic digestibility.

Thermal and enzymatic pretreatment of sludge containing phthalate esters prior to mesophilic anaerobic digestion,"The present study aimed at investigating the effect of thermal pretreatment of sludge at 70degreesC on the anaerobic degradation of three commonly found phthalic acid esters (PAE): di-ethyl phthalate (DEP), di-butyl phthalate (DBP), and di-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). Also, the enzymatic treatment at 28degreesC with a commercial lipase was studied as a way to enhance PAE removal. Pretreatment at 70degreesC of the sludge containing PAE negatively influenced the anaerobic biodegradability of phthalate esters at 37degreesC. The observed reduction of PAE biodegradation rates after the thermal pretreatment was found to be proportional to the PAE solubility in water: the higher the solubility, the higher the percentage of the reduction (DEP > DBP > DEHP). PAE were slowly degraded during the pretreatment at 70degreesC, yet this was probably due to physicochemical reactions than to microbial/biological activity. Therefore, thermal pretreatment of sludge containing PAE should be either avoided or combined with a treatment step focusing on PAE reduction. On the other hand, enzymatic treatment was very efficient in the removal of PAE. The enzymatic degradation of DBP, DEP, and DEHP could be one to two orders of magnitude faster than under normal mesophilic anaerobic conditions. Moreover, the enzymatic treatment resulted in the shortest half-life of DEHP in sludge reported so far. Our study further showed that enzymatic treatment with lipases can be applied to raw sludge and its efficiency does not depend on the solids concentration.

Enhanced digestion of bio-pretreated sawdust using a novel bacterial consortium: Microbial community structure and methane-producing pathways,"Anaerobic digestion is widely considered the most cost effective and sustainable technology for bio-waste to energy valorization. Several substrates show a certain recalcitrance to the process evolution, such as sawdust. To this aim, in this study, sawdust has been subjected to a biological pretreatment by means of a novel bacterial consortium before its biomethanation. This novel lignocellulose-degrading bacterial consortium, isolated from several carpentries, has been constructed to predict the sawdust biological pretreatment efficacy. A five days bacterial pretreatment led to a significant reduction in the sawdust cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin contents, towards the control, of 35.8, 37.1 and 46.2% respectively. Microbial diversity was analyzed by VIT (R) gene probe. Methanogenesis was carried out through acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic pathways. For a forty days digestion time, the biological pretreatment enhanced the cumulative biogas and biomethane production respectively of 86.4 and 92.2% compared to the control. With respect to the state of art, the use of this constructed novel consortium pretreatment can significantly increase the biomethane yield, making the digestion more effective and consequently improving the processes economic feasibility. Moreover, this process can be easily integrated in existing biogas plants for making co-digestion processes still more elastic with regard to the available feedstock.","Ali, SS; Al-Tohamy, R; Manni, A; Luz, FC; Elsamahy, T; Sun, JZ",Anaerobic digestion; Lignocellulose biomass; Microbial consortium; Methanogens; Sawdust; Biological pretreatment,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2019.06.012,Biological,microbial consortium,bacterial,wood,sawdust,oak,92,83.444,,,16,45,20.5,26.4
Influence of pretreatment conditions on lignocellulosic fractions and methane production from grape pomace,"The lignocellulosic structure of grape pomace requires the use of pretreatments facilitating microbial decomposition of the matter and enhancing methane production.

Effect of alkaline pretreatment on mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion of a submerged macrophyte: Inhibition and recovery against dissolved lignin during semi-continuous operation,"The long-term effect of alkaline pretreatment on semi-continuous anaerobic digestion ( AD) of the ligninrich submerged macrophyte Potamogeton maackianus was investigated using mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. In pretreated reactors, dissolved lignin accumulated to high levels. CH4 production under the pretreated condition was higher than that of the untreated condition, but decreased from Days 22 (mesophilic) and 42 (thermophilic). However, CH4 production subsequently recovered, although dissolved lignin accumulated. Further, the change in the microbial community was observed between conditions. These results suggest that dissolved lignin temporarily inhibited AD, although acclimatization to dissolved lignin occurred during long-term operation. During the steady state period, mesophilic conditions achieved a 42% increase in the CH4 yield using pretreatment, while thermophilic conditions yielded an 8% increment. Because volatile fatty acids accumulated even after acclimatization during the thermophilic pretreated condition and was discharged with the effluent, improvement of the methanogenic step would enable enhanced CH4 recovery.

Insights into anaerobic transformation of key dissolved organic matters produced by thermal hydrolysis sludge pretreatment,"The detailed dissolved organic matters (DOMs) profile by thermal hydrolysis pretreatment and their transformation during anaerobic digestion (AD) were investigated. Among the temperature tested, 172 degrees C treatment showed the best sludge solubilization and the maximum methane production. The study revealed that high temperature sludge pretreatment mainly improved the release of low molecular weight (LMW) proteins, LMW neutrals and LMW polysaccharides. Notably, the effluent from thermal treated sludge digesters contained more DOMs residues. The predominant residual DOMs were humic substances, LMW proteins and LMW neutrals. At the molecular level, over 50% of the residual LMW components were slowly biodegradable or nonbiodegradable steroid-like compounds and aromatics. Further profiling of the higher MW compounds detected the recalcitrant or inhibitory compounds, e.g. benzenoids, flavonoids, pyridines and their derivatives. It is recommended that polishing step should be considered to further reduce the refractory residues in AD liquor.","Lu, D; Sun, FQ; Zhou, Y",Anaerobic digestion; Dissolved organic matters; Refractory compounds; Thermal hydrolysis pretreatment,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.06.059,Physical,thermal,thermal hydrolysis,activated sludge,was,,1.5,1.1,,,,,,
Examining the mechanisms of short-term solubilization of ground food waste for high-rate anaerobic digestion,"Optimizing short-term solubilization is essential for high-rate anaerobic digestion of food waste. The purpose of this study was to measure the short-term kinetics of food waste solubilization and understand what mechanisms are responsible for driving food waste solubilization. Two solubilization assays were conducted to measure the solubilization of mechanically processed food waste. Three methods of mechanical grinding were utilized: an in-sink food disposer and a manual meat grinder with either small or medium size plate openings. A control assay was conducted to measure the release of endogenous soluble material into an aqueous medium. An enzyme assay was conducted to examine short-term food waste hydrolysis. The assays were diluted and buffered to prevent product and pH inhibition, respectively, and allow maximum solubilization to occur. Percent solubilization was calculated as the soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) fraction of total COD. Data from the two assays were used to calculate the kinetics of endogenous solubilization and enzymatic hydrolysis. Regardless of grinding method, food waste was 27% solubilized within 1 h through endogenous solubilization. Enzymatic hydrolysis was responsible for an additional 29-31% solubilization by 4 h. This study showed that ground food waste was approximately 60% solubilized within 4 h under optimal conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Three methods of mechanical grinding were utilized: an in-sink food disposer and a manual meat grinder with either small or medium size plate openings. A control assay was conducted to measure the release of endogenous soluble material into an aqueous medium. An enzyme assay was conducted to examine short-term food waste hydrolysis. The assays were diluted and buffered to prevent product and pH inhibition, respectively, and allow maximum solubilization to occur. Percent solubilization was calculated as the soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) fraction of total COD. Data from the two assays were used to calculate the kinetics of endogenous solubilization and enzymatic hydrolysis. Regardless of grinding method, food waste was 27% solubilized within 1 h through endogenous solubilization. Enzymatic hydrolysis was responsible for an additional 29-31% solubilization by 4 h. This study showed that ground food waste was approximately 60% solubilized within 4 h under optimal conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Influence of thermal hydrolysis pretreatment on organic transformation characteristics of high solid anaerobic digestion,The study evaluated the influence of thermal hydrolysis pretreatment (THP) on anaerobic digestion (AD) ability of high solid sludge. The transformation characteristics of organics during the THP + AD process of dewatering sludge from wastewater treatment plant was investigated using a lab-scale THP reactor and four anaerobic digesters. The reduction efficiency of volatile suspended solids using THP + AD exceeded 49%. The acceleration of biogas production during AD was due to the enhancement of protein hydrolysis and acidogenesis by THP. THP had only minimal influence on the improvement of carbohydrate acidogenesis. The hydrolysis of poly phosphates was likely the main reaction of phosphorus transformation. Biochemical generation of sulfide and ammonia nitrogen occurred during the acidogenesis.,"Han, Y; Zhuo, Y; Peng, DC; Yao, Q; Li, HJ; Qu, QL",High solid sludge; Thermal hydrolysis pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Substance transformation,2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.07.166,Physical,thermal,thermal hydrolysis,activated sludge,dewatered sludge,,,,,,,,,
A new mechanical cutting pretreatment approach towards the improvement of primary sludge fermentation and anaerobic digestion,"Pretreatment technologies for improving the anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge have been studied extensively; however, studies on the improvement of pretreatment technology for primary sludge (PS) fermentation and anaerobic digestion are scarce. In this study, a novel mechanical cutting pretreatment (MCP) method was proposed to enhance the performance of PS fermentation and anaerobic digestion. PS was disintegrated by MCP, the average particle size of PS reduced from 45.7 mu m to 7.0 mu m, and soluble COD (SCOD) increased by 1206 mg/L with pretreatment for 8 min. The hydrolysis and acidification of PS was promoted significantly by MCP. Compared with the control group, the production of SCOD and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in the pretreatment group during sludge fermentation increased by 167% and 115.3%, respectively. The performance of PS anaerobic digestion was remarkably improved by MCP. The maximum cumulative biogas production in the pretreatment group was 3153 mL, which was 6.33 times that in the control group (498.5 mL). Sludge disintegration by mechanical pretreatment resulted in the enrichment of bacteria, especially Firmicutes, in the sludge fermentation system, and the quantity of bacteria in the pretreatment group was 1.95 times that in the control group. However, MCP had little effect on archaea in the anaerobic digestion of PS, and the methanogens in the control and pretreatment reactors were 1.493 x 10(9) and 1.519 x 10(9) copies/g, respectively.","Wang, XB; Xie, YL; Qi, XF; Chen, TT; Zhang, YD; Gao, CY; Zhang, AL; Ren, WA",Primary sludge; Mechanical cutting pretreatment; Sludge disintegration; Sludge fermentation; Anaerobic digestion,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2022.107163,Physical,mechanical desintegration,cutting,activated sludge,primary sludge,,,,,,,,,
Improving anaerobic digestion of corn straw by using solid-state urea pretreatment,"The resistant structure and high carbon/nitrogen ratio (C/N) of cellulosic substrate are the barriers during their anaerobic digestion (AD). Solid-state urea pretreatment was developed in this study to pretreat corn straw and adjust C/N ratio simultaneously for the downstream AD of corn straw. Results showed solid-state urea pretreatment was efficient in lignin removal and achieved the highest lignin reduction of 7.06% with C/N ratio = 15 during pretreatment. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the destruction of the dense structure by pretreatment, which benefited to the hydrolysis of corn straw. The cumulative methane yields of the pretreated corn straw ranged from 234.07 to 250.03 mL/g VS, which were obviously higher than that of the untreated corn straw. The maximum methane yield of 250.03 mL/g VS was achieved with C/N = 15 during pretreatment, which was 23.91% higher than that of the untreated group. In addition, AD digestates from the pretreated groups had 9.62% higher nutrients than that from the untreated group. The solid-state urea pretreatment can destroy the dense structure of corn straw and regulate the C/N ratio during AD, thus benefit the methane production and fertilizer use of the digestate, which is a potential choice during the AD of cellulosic substrate.","Xie, Z; Zou, H; Zheng, Y; Fu, SF",Corn straw; Anaerobic digestion; Urea pretreatment; C; N ratio; Methane yield,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.133559,Process improvement,nutrient,urea,lignocellulose,corn,straw,92.4,86.75436,42.39,0.87,48.59,,,
Performance evaluation and microbial community analysis of microaerobic pretreatment on thermophilic dry anaerobic digestion,"In this study, micmaembic pretreatment (MP) was used to improve the system stability and biogas production performance of the thermophilic dry anaerobic digestion (AD). The results showed that proper MP made the AD have better methane-producing performance and the maximum cumulative methane production was 108.31 mL/g VS with an oxygen load of 5 mL/g VS, which was 13.20 % higher than that of control group (G1, 95.68 mL/g VS). Specific micmaerobic conditions promoted the generation of volatile fatty acid (VFA) and reduced propionic acid content in the digestive system. In addition, the volatile solid (VS) removal rate of the digestive substrates was improved in the presence of limited oxygen, which can reduce environmental risks. Microbial community diversity indicated that MP increased the relative abundance of Firmicutes to promote substrate hydrolysis and accelerated the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens to improve AD performance.","Zhen, F; Luo, XJ; Xing, T; Sun, YM; Kong, XY; Li, WZ",Microaerobic pretreatment; Dry anaerobic digestion; Microbial community; Corn stalk; Methane production,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2020.107873,Biological,aerobic,microaerobic,lignocellulose,corn,stalk,93,89,42.25,0.42,101,,,
"Effect of ultrasonic and ozone pretreatment on the fate of enteric indicator bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes, and anaerobic digestion of dairy wastewater","In this study, the effect of ultrasound (US), ozone and US combined with ozone (US/ozone) pretreatments on the fate of enteric indicator bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and anaerobic digestion (AD) of dairy wastewater was investigated. The pretreatment conditions included US power 200 W, ozone concentration 4.2 mg O-3/L, and pretreatment time 0-30 min. The results showed that US/ozone pretreatment was effective in the inactivation of enteric indicator bacteria. Total coliforms and enterococci were reduced by 99% and 92% after 30 min US/ozone pretreatment.

Methane Production Variability According to Miscanthus Genotype and Alkaline Pretreatments at High Solid Content,"In the context of increasing needs of lignocellulosic biomass for emerging biorefinery, miscanthus is expected to represent a resource for energy production. Regarding biogas production, its potential may be improved either by genotype selection or pretreatment. Eight different miscanthus genotypes belonging to Miscanthus x giganteus (FLO, GID and H8), M. sacchariflorus (GOL, MAL, AUG, H6) and M. sinensis (H5) species were first compared for biomass composition and potential methane. In a second time, alkali pretreatments (NaOH 10g100g(TS)(-1), CaO 10g100g(TS)(-1)) were applied at ambient temperature and high solid content, in different conditions of duration and particle size on the genotype FLO presenting the lowest methane potential. The methane potential varied between miscanthus genotypes with values ranging from 166 +/- 10 to 202 +/- 7NmL(CH4)g(VS)(-1). All of the studied pretreatments increased the methane production up to 55% and reduced Klason lignin and holocellulose contents up to 37%. From this study, NaOH was more efficient than CaO with an increase of the methane production between 24 and 55% and between 19 and 30%, respectively.","Thomas, HL; Arnoult, S; Brancourt-Hulmel, M; Carrere, H",Alkaline pretreatments; Miscanthus; Genotypes; Lignocellulosic biomass; Anaerobic digestion; High solid content,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-018-9957-5,Chemical,alkaline,naoh+cao,lignocellulose,miscanthus,plant,,,,,,,,

Fed-batch anaerobic digestion of raw and pretreated hazelnut skin over long-term operation,"This study provided important insights on the anaerobic digestion (AD) of hazelnut skin (HS) by operating a fedbatch AD reactor over 240 days and focusing on several factors impacting the process in the long term. An efficient reactor configuration was proposed to increase the substrate load while reducing the solid retention time during the fed-batch AD of HS. Raw HS produced maximally 19.29 mL CH4/g VSadd/d. Polyphenols accumulated in the reactor and the use of NaOH to adjust the pH likely inhibited AD. Maceration and methanolorganosolv pretreatments were, thus, used to remove polyphenols from HS (i.e. 82 and 97%, respectively) and improve HS biodegradation. Additionally, organosolv pretreatment removed 9% of the lignin. The organosolvpretreated HS showed an increment in methane potential of 21%, while macerated HS produced less methane than the raw substrate, probably due to the loss of non-structural sugars during maceration.","Oliva, A; Tan, L; Papirio, S; Esposito, G; Lens, PNL",Fed-batch anaerobic digestion; Lignocellulosic materials; Hazelnut skin; Polyphenols; Organosolv pretreatment,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.127372,Chemical,solvent,organosolv,lignocellulose,hazelnut,skin,,,,,,,,
Assessment of corn stover pretreated with shock and alkali using methane-arrested anaerobic digestion,"Corn stover, an underutilized agricultural residue, is a promising lignocellulosic feedstock for producing biofuels. To fully utilize it, pretreatment is needed. Typically, pretreatments are rapidly assessed using extracellular enzymes that release sugars from cellulose and hemicellulose. In contrast, this study uses methane-arrested anaerobic digestion (MAAD) to assess pretreatments. Although time consuming, MAAD is a more accurate assessment technique when lignocellulose is employed in the carboxylate platform, a promising approach that utilizes nearly all biomass components. Using recommended pretreatment conditions identified from a previous study, three corn stover pretreatments were compared using MAAD: (1) shock-only, (2) NaOH-only, and (3) shock + NaOH. Air-dried sewage sludge was used as nutrient source. At 100 g/L initial substrate concentration, compared to untreated corn stover, shock-only decreased conversion (amount of biomass digested) by 14%, NaOH-only increased conversion by 82%, and shock + NaOH increased conversion by 104%. Using batch MAAD data, the continuum particle distribution model simulated four-stage countercurrent fermentation. At an industrial non-acid volatile solids (NAVS) concentration of 300 g/L-liq, for both NaOH-only and shock + NaOH, the model predicts total carboxylic acid concentration of about 58 g/L and conversion of about 0.85 g NAVS(digested)/g NAVS(fed) at liquid retention time of 35 days and volatile solid loading rate of 4 g/(L-liq.day). At this long solid residence time, shock is not necessary; however, with short solid residence times, shock acts synergistically to aid NaOH pretreatment. Shock treatment offers a way to reduce pretreatment costs without sacrificing pretreatment efficacy.","Olokede, O; Hsu, SC; Ju, H; Helms, E; Broyles, A; Holtzapple, M",alkali treatment; biomass pretreatment; methane-arrested anaerobic digestion; MixAlco; shock treatment,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/btpr.3257,Chemical,alkaline,,lignocellulose,corn,stover,,,,,,,,

The changes of microplastics' behavior in adsorption and anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge induced by hydrothermal pretreatment,"Waste activated sludge (WAS) contains high concentrations of microplastics (MPs), which could serve as vectors of various organic pollutants and heavy metals, causing synergistic transportation and pollution. The application of combined hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) and anaerobic digestion (AD) has raised growing concerns since the low-temperature hydrothermal treatment could enhance the biogas production of WAS. However, the changes in physicochemical properties, adsorption performances, and effects on AD of MPs by HTP have not been studied. The study used three typical MPs in WAS, and it was found that the HTP (170 degrees C & 30min) increased MPs' specific surface area and carbonyl index (CI) while decreasing the relative crystallinity. The adsorption capacity to Cd increased through the carbonylation for polyethylene microplastic (PE-MP) and polystyrene microplastic (PS-MP) while decreasing by the dechlorination for polyvinyl chloride microplastic (PVC-MP). Meanwhile, increased hydrophilicity reduced the adsorption capacities of all three typical MPs for ofloxacin. The above results indicated that the HTP could be worth blocking the adsorption of polar MPs for polar pollutants. For the pristine MPs, only PVC-MP at the highest concentration (0.5 g kg(-1) VS) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced methane production by 16.2 +/- 3.3% of WAS without the HTP. However, the HTP resulted in significant (p < 0.05) inhibition of methane production of WAS at high concentrations of PE-MP and PVC-MP (e.g., 0.1 and 0.5 g kg(-1) VS), which was due to the acceleration of the released toxic plastic additives (dibutyl phthalate, dimethyl phthalate, and bisphenol-A). Microbial analysis showed the abundances of vital anaerobes, such as acid-producing bacteria (Acetoanerrobium and Mesotoga), proteolytic bacteria (Proteiniborus), and methanogens (Methanosaeta) clearly decreased with the PE-MP and PVC-MP after the HTP, which might result in the decreased methane production. The study provided deep-insight of MPs' behaviors during the combined HTP-AD process.","Jiang, C; Ni, BJ; Zheng, XW; Lu, B; Chen, Z; Gao, Y; Zhang, YL; Zhang, SC; Luo, G",Microplastics; Waste activated sludge; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Physicochemical property; Adsorption; Anaerobic digestion,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.118744,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,activated sludge,dewatered sludge,plastics,,,,,,,,
THERMAL PRETREATMENT OF CONCENTRATED DISTILLERY SPENT WASH,"A novel thermal pretreatment reported earlier was employed to treat concentrated distillery spent wash to reduce the quantity to be handled at high pressure and high temperature involved in the proposed process. Three types of concentrated wastes, namely, high molecular weight high COD fraction obtained after membrane filtration of distillery waste, concentrated wastes obtained from distillery employing indirect heating, and concentration by partial evaporation of spent wash under vacuum, were studied to establish suitability of the proposed process for concentrated wastes. Thermal pretreatment at 230-degrees-C for 2 hours resulted in formation of charred residue having properties like lignite coal. The reduction in COD of the liquid phase was due to the separation of residue. Effect of dilution by treated waste on pretreatment was studied to estimate backmixing effect. Attempts were made to evaluate performance of different concentrated wastes in terms of extent of COD reduction, net energy recovery, and biodegradability. Other operational parameters, such as filterability, total pressure, and ease of handling of residue, were also evaluated.

Methane yield prediction of ultrasonic pretreated sewage sludge by means of an artificial neural network,"In this study, anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge with different ultrasonic pretreatment (USp) conditions was investigated. USp were applied at a constant ultrasonic density of 0.5 W/mL with sonication times of 0-240 min. While the methane yield of the untreated (control) reactor was 170.1 +/- 4.7 mL/g volatile solids (VS), the highest methane yield was 266.1 +/- 7.5 mL/g VS in the reactor where sonication was applied for 120 min. Actual specific energy input (SEA)/nominal specific energy input (SEN) ratios after USps were measured for pretreatment yield. These values varied between 77.0 and 14.87% according to different sonication times. Sonication times of more than 30 min did not significantly increase the methane yield due to possible reflocculation. After the USps, various cumulative methane yields were predicted via the modified Gompertz Model, modified Logistic Model, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model (Scenario 1); of these the ANN model made predictions that were closest to the experimental data. In the other part of the study, ANN was trained by experimental pretreatment conditions and methane yields were successfully predicted by taking different USp parameters (different sonication times, SEA values and incremental soluble chemical oxygen demand % values) as input variables (Scenarios 2, 3 and 4). Regression analyses showed values close to 1, indicating that the prediction of the ANN model correlated linearly with experimental data. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

New insight into volatile sulfur compounds conversion in anaerobic digestion of excess sludge: Influence of free ammonia nitrogen and thermal hydrolysis pretreatment,"Volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) are the main toxic components generated simultaneously with biogas in anaerobic digestion (AD) of sludge. The differences of chemical and biological processes involved in the VSCs conversion between conventional AD and thermal hydrolysis pretreated high solid AD (THP-HSAD), widely applied in recent years, have yet to be fully elucidated. This study evaluated the effect of solid content, initial pH, and thermal hydrolysis on the VSCs conversion in AD. This study had evidenced that neither the solids content nor the pH adjustment affects the VSCs conversion. It was found that free ammonia nitrogen concentration, which increased (>500 mg/L) in HSAD, directly inhibited the enzymatic activity of cysteine lyase (R-2 = 0.87, P < 0.01) and methionine lyase (R-2 = 0.89, P < 0.01), thereby affecting the VSCs conversion. Thermal hydrolysis pretreatment (THP) had no consequential impact on the key enzymes involved in the VSCs conversion. Instead, the particle size of excess sludge reduced by 66.05 +/- 6.66%. It was postulated that THP may reduce the sludge particle size, increasing the contact of sulfur compounds with invertase, thus favoring VSCs conversion. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms and control measures of the VSCs conversion during the AD of sludge. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

"Anaerobic digestion of hydrothermally-pretreated lignocellulosic biomass: Influence of pretreatment temperatures, inhibitors and soluble organics on methane yield","Anaerobic digestion (AD) of lignocellulosic biomass has received significant attention for bioenergy production in recent years. However, hydrolysis is a rate-limiting in AD of such feedstock. In this study, effects of hydrothermal pretreatment of Napier grass, a model lignocellulosic biomass, on methane yield were examined through series of batch and semi-continuous studies. In batch studies, the highest methane yield of 248.2 +/- 5.5 NmL CH4/g volatile solids (VS)(added) was obtained from the biomass pretreated at 175 degrees C, which was 35% higher than that from the unpretreated biomass. The biomass pretreated at 200 degrees C resulted in formation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural, which significantly inhibited methanogenesis. In semi-continuous studies, digester fed with the biomass pretreated at 200 degrees C at organic loading rate (OLR) of 4 g VS/L.d resulted in digester failure. Thus, OLRsoluble/OLRtotal ratio < 200 is proposed as an operating criterion for effective operation of digester fed with pretreated biomass slurry.","Phuttaro, C; Sawatdeenarunat, C; Surendra, KC; Boonsawang, P; Chaiprapat, S; Khanal, SK",Lignocellulosic biomass; Napier grass; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Inhibitory by-products,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.03.114,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,lignocellulose,napier grass,grass,,,,,,,,
Assessment of different mechanical treatments for improving the anaerobic biodegradability of residual raspberry extrudate,"Mechanical treatments can be simple and feasible methods for enhancing the anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic substrates. This work aims to relate the direct effect of five different mechanical treatments, i.e., variation in the size and number of particles, with the variations in the chemical composition and, subsequently, the effect over the anaerobic digestion of residual raspberry extrudate, which was used as a model substrate. A high variation in the number of particles and the particle size distribution was achieved depending on the mechanical treatment applied, reaching the highest number of particles for the treatments with knife mills and mortar (around 8000 particles per gram). The higher number of particles was related to higher solubilisation, including phenolic compounds and sugars. The combination of knife mills and mortar pretreatment, which presented the highest number of particles, resulted in a 66% more of polyphenols in comparison to the raw substrate. However, the presence of anthocyanins was higher in mechanical treatments with less effect. The enhancement of the anaerobic digestion was clearly related to the increment in the number of particles of small size after the mechanical treatments. The highest methane yield coefficient (236 & PLUSMN; 11 mL CH4/g volatile solids) was achieved for the raspberry extrudate treated with knife mills.","Trujillo-Reyes, A; Sinisgalli, E; Cubero-Cardoso, J; Perez, AGG; Serrano, A; Borja, R; Fermoso, FGG",Anaerobic digestion; Ellagic acid; Lignin; Particle size distribution; Pretreatment; Raspberry achenes,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.12.034,Physical,mechanical desintegration,mechanical,lignocellulose,rasberry,extrudates,,,,,,,,
"Anaerobic Digestion and Hot Water Pretreatment of Tropically Grown C-4 Energy Grasses: Mass, Carbon, and Energy Conversions from Field Biomass to Fuels","The efficacy of C-4 grasses as feedstocks for liquid fuel production and their climate mitigation potential remain unresolved in the tropics. To identify highly convertible C-4 grasses, we measured final fuels and postprocess biomass produced in two laboratory-scale conversion pathways across 12 species and varieties within the Poaceae (grass) family. Total mass, carbon, and energy in final fuels and postprocess biomass were assessed based on field mass and area-based production. Two lignocellulosic processes were investigated: (1) anaerobic digestion (AD) to methane and (2) hot water pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis (HWP-EH) to ethanol. We found AD converted lignocellulose to methane more efficiently in terms of carbon and energy compared to ethanol production using HWP-EH, although improvements to and the optimization of each process could change these contrasts.

"Anaerobic Digestion and Hot Water Pretreatment of Tropically Grown C-4 Energy Grasses: Mass, Carbon, and Energy Conversions from Field Biomass to Fuels","The efficacy of C-4 grasses as feedstocks for liquid fuel production and their climate mitigation potential remain unresolved in the tropics. To identify highly convertible C-4 grasses, we measured final fuels and postprocess biomass produced in two laboratory-scale conversion pathways across 12 species and varieties within the Poaceae (grass) family.

Two lignocellulosic processes were investigated: (1) anaerobic digestion (AD) to methane and (2) hot water pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis (HWP-EH) to ethanol.

Anaerobic digestion of pulp and paper mill sludge pretreated by microbial consortium OEM1 with simultaneous degradation of lignocellulose and chlorophenols,"This work focused on the anaerobic digestion performance of pulp and paper mill sludge (PPMS) pretreated with the microbial consortium OEM1, and exposing the mechanism of performance variations as well. It was found that the methane yield was increased 1.4-fold by pretreating feedstocks with the active OEM1, and the maximum methane yield of 429.19 mL/gVS was noted. Moreover, an appropriate pH range of 6.1-7.5 was found in this digester, and no VFA inhibition was observed. A higher level of stability was also detected in this system based on the analysis of ORP, alkalinity and VFA/TA ratio. Also, a higher lignin decomposition rate was determined in the coupled pretreatment - AD process with the active OEM1 addition, and a 5-fold increase of AOX degradation efficiency was found in the pretreatment stage. Hence, a brighter future of developing OEM1 pretreatment for PPMS before AD could be predicted based on the capabilities of selective delignification and effective AOX degradation.

Performance of anaerobic waste activated sludge digesters after microwave pretreatment,"Effects of microwave pretreatment on waste activated sludge (WAS) in mesophilic semicontinuous digesters with acclimatized inoculum at solids retention times (SRTs) of 5, 10, and 20 days are presented. Batch digesters determined optimum microwave temperature, intensity, WAS concentration, and percentage of WAS pretreated for highest WAS solubilization (soluble to total chemical oxygen demand ratio [SCOD:TCOD]) and biogas production. Pretreatment results indicated the potential to damage floe structure and release 4.2-, 4.5-, and 3.6-fold higher soluble proteins, sugars, and SCOD:TCODs compared with controls, with nucleic acid release. Pretreatment increased dewaterability and bioavailability of WAS with 20% higher biogas production compared with controls in batch digestion. In semicontinuous digesters, relative (to control) improvements in removals dramatically increased, as SRT was shortened from 20 to 10 to 5 days, with 23 and 26% higher volatile solids removals for WAS pretreated to 96 degrees C by microwave and conventional heating at a 5-day SRT.","Eskicioglu, C; Droste, RL; Kennedy, KJ",anaerobic digestion; microwave; pretreatment; waste activated sludge; solubilization; solids retention time,2007,http://dx.doi.org/10.2175/106143007X176004,Physical,thermal,microwave,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Alkali pretreatment enhances biogas production in the anaerobic digestion of pulp and paper sludge,"The objective of this research was to develop an alkali pretreatment process prior to anaerobic digestion (AD) of pulp and paper sludge (PPS) to improve the methane productivity. Different concentrations of sodium hydroxide solution were used to pretreat PPS, and then followed by AD of PPS and monosodium glutamate waste liquor (MGWL). Laboratory-scale experiments were carried out in completely mixed bioreactors, 1 L capacity with 700mL. worked. Optimal amount of sodium hydroxide for organics solubilization in the step of pretreatment was 8 g NaOH/100g TSstudge. Under this condition, the PPS flocs structure was well disrupted resulting in the void rate and fiber size decreased after pretreatment, and SCOD increased up to 83% as well as the peak value of VIA concentration attained 1040 mg acetic acid/L. during AD. The AD efficiency of PPS with and without pretreatment was evaluated. The highest methane yield under optimal pretreatment condition was 0.32 m(3) CH4/kg VSremoval, 183.5% of the control. The results indicated that alkali/NaOH pretreatment could be an effective method for improving methane yield with PPS. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Anaerobic and Microaerobic Pretreatment for Improving Methane Production From Paper Waste in Anaerobic Digestion,"Having been generated with a tremendous amount annually, paper waste (PW) represents a large proportion in municipal solid waste (MSW) and also a potential source of renewable energy production through the application of anaerobic digestion (AD). However, the recalcitrant lignocellulosic structure poses obstacles to efficient utilization in this way. Recently, anaerobic and microaerobic pretreatment have attracted attention as approaches to overcome the obstacles of biogas production. This study was set out to present a systematic comparison and assessment of anaerobic and microaerobic pretreatment of PW with different oxygen loadings by five microbial agents: composting inoculum (CI), straw-decomposing inoculum (SI), cow manure (CM), sheep manure (SM), and digestate effluent (DE). The hints of microbial community evolution during the pretreatment and AD were tracked by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. The results demonstrated that PW pretreated by DE with an oxygen loading of 15 ml/gVS showed the highest cumulative methane yield (CMY) of 343.2 ml/gVS, with a BD of 79.3%. In addition to DE, SI and SM were also regarded as outstanding microbial agents for pretreatment because of the acceleration of methane production at the early stage of AD. The microbial community analysis showed that Clostridium sensu stricto 1 and Clostridium sensu stricto 10 possessed high relative abundance after anaerobic pretreatment by SI, while Bacteroides and Macellibacteroides were enriched after microaerobic pretreatment by SM, which were all contributable to the cellulose degradation. Besides, aerobic Bacillus in SI and Acinetobacter in SM and DE probably promoted lignin degradation only under microaerobic conditions. During AD, VadinBC27, Ruminococcaceae Incertae Sedis, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Fastidiosipila, and Caldicoprobacter were the crucial bacteria that facilitated the biodegradation of PW. By comparing the groups with same microbial agent, it could be found that changing the oxygen loading might result in the alternation between hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens, which possibly affected the methanogenesis stage. This study not only devised a promising tactic for making full use of PW but also provided a greater understanding of the evolution of microbial community in the pretreatment and AD processes, targeting the efficient utilization of lignocellulosic biomass in full-scale applications.","Song, C; Li, WW; Cai, FF; Liu, GQ; Chen, C",paper waste; anaerobic pretreatment; microaerobic pretreatment; microbial community analysis; anaerobic digestion,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.688290,Biological,microbial consortium,microaerobic,lignocellulose,paper,waste,,,,,,,,
Exergy analysis and optimization of bio-methane production from corn stalk pretreated by compound bacteria based on genetic algorithm,"An exergy equilibrium model was established to obtain the exergy efficiency under different conditions of compound bacteria pretreatment and anaerobic digestion (AD) of corn stalk. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) was applied to optimize the exergy efficiency of the combination process of the pretreatment and AD. The maximum exergy efficiency with the GA was 19.04%, corresponding to the optimal pretreatment parameters: pretreatment temperature 33.34 degrees C, stalk particle size 0.50 mm, ventilation rate 0.88 L/min, pretreatment time 169.03 h. The optimal AD parameters were: digestion temperature 38.08 degrees C and stirring rate 48.04 r/min. The validation experiment exergy efficiency reached to 19.25%, which was 24.37% higher as compared to that of the non pretreatment process. Under these optimal conditions, the energy consumption of the compound bacteria pretreatment and the time of the bio-methane production process were effectively reduced.","Zhang, H; Guo, CP; Jiao, YZ; Liu, XX; He, C; Awasthi, MK; Liu, L; Chang, C",Compound bacteria pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Corn stalk; Exergy efficiency; Genetic Algorithm,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.126413,Biological,microbial consortium,,lignocellulose,corn,stalk,,,,,,34,26,15
Combination of ultrasonic and acidic pretreatments for enhancing biohythane production from tofu processing residue via one-stage anaerobic digestion,"Tofu processing residues (TPR) have received more attention as a source of bioenergy.

For concentrated sludge AD, the pH buffer system ensured the inhibitory steady state during start-up period, and significant archaeal community shift from Methanosaeta to Methanosarcina ensured the true steady-state operation. Pretreatment further increased the relative abundance of functional microbia such as Bacteroidales, Clostridiales and Methanosarcina, and resulted in the decrease of viscosity of digested sludge in reactors.

Effect of dewatered sludge microwave pretreatment temperature and duration on net energy generation and biosolids quality from anaerobic digestion,"The effects of microwave (MW) final temperature (80 and 160 degrees C) and holding time (1 and 30 minutes) were evaluated by ten anaerobic digesters (AD). MW was applied to dewatered secondary sludge with total solids of 10.5 +/- 0.5% (by weight) to minimize energy input. Mixed sludge was digested under thermophilic and mesophilic conditions at sludge retention times (SRTs) of 20, 12, and 6 days. MW final temperature had significantly higher effect on solubilization than holding time. At MW of 80/160 degrees C, longer holding times further enhanced solubilization but increased volatile fatty acid accumulation at thermophilic SRT of 6 days. While all mesophilic digesters met the Class B requirement in terms of pathogens removal, all thermophilic digesters produced Class A biosolids. MW-ADs were able to tolerate 15-20% higher loading rates compared to controls. Up to 21% higher organics removals were achieved by MW. MW at 160 degrees C generated the highest amount of extra heat that could be used within/outside of plant. However energy recovered from the enhanced methane production was not sufficient to cover the electrical energy consumed by MW. Therefore, a custom-designed electromagnetic heating unit based on dielectric properties of sludge is needed to minimize energy input and maximize energy recovery for full-scale applications.

Biological pretreatment applied to industrial organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (OFMSW): Effect on anaerobic digestion,"The application of the anaerobic digestion for the treatment of the industrial organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) has currently been of special interest. The main barrier in the treatment of this type or organic waste is its biotransformation, due to the complexity of organic material. Therefore, the first step must be its physical, chemical and biological pretreatment for breaking complex molecules into simple monomers, to increase solubilization of organic material and improve the efficiency of the anaerobic treatment in the second step. This article describes the application of biological pretreatment based on mature compost addition, in order to enhance organic matter solubilization and, hence, the biogas and methane production and the organic matter removal during the anaerobic digestion of the industrial OFMSW. Laboratory-scale experiments were carried out in semicontinuous completely mixed reactor, 5-L capacity. Optimal conditions for organic matter solubilization in the first step of pretreatment were: mature compost as biological agent, 2.5% (v/v) of inoculation percentage and 24h as incubation period. The anaerobic digestion efficiency of the industrial OFMSW, with and without pretreatment, was evaluated for a solid retention time of 15 days. Under those conditions the organic matter removal percentage, in terms of eliminated dissolved organic carbon and volatile solids, was increased up to 61.2% and 35.3% respectively over the control without pretreatment. As consequence, the biogas and methane production are improved up to 60.0% and 73.3% respectively. The highest cumulative biogas and methane production under anaerobic digestion were obtained with pretreated waste: 178.6 L and 82.6 L against 61.6 L and 34.2 L of the control without pretreatment. The results have shown that biological pretreatment with mature compost, followed by dry-thermophilic anaerobic digestion, provides the best results for stabilizing the industrial OFMSW.

Zero-valent iron is not always effective in enhancing anaerobic digestion performance,"Liquid nitrogen was employed as a low-temperature medium to activate zero-valent iron (ZVI) powder in an attempt to strengthen its enhancement effect on anaerobic digestion (AD) of swine manure (SM). Surprisingly, it was found that both pristine ZVI and liquid nitrogen-pretreated ZVI (LZVI) did not significantly improve the AD performance or change the archaeal community structure. It was hypothesized that ZVI might not be effective at stress-free environment like in these digesters. To confirm this, an additional set of AD experiments were performed at high ammonia stress (about 4000 mg/L), results showed that ZVI and LZVI greatly alleviated ammonia inhibition and increased the CH4 yield by 11.6% and 28.2%, respectively. Apparently, ZVI mainly affected AD systems by changing the metabolism pathways and enhancing the microbial activity to overcome process inhibition, and pretreatment of liquid nitrogen could significantly accelerate the dissolution of ZVI and improve its utilization efficiency, contributing to a greater extend of process recovery and improvement.","Ai, ZY; Zheng, SC; Liu, D; Wang, SY; Wang, HQ; Huang, WL; Lei, ZF; Zhang, ZY; Yang, F; Huang, WW",Methane; Anaerobic digestion; Zero-valent iron; Liquid nitrogen pretreatment; Swine manure,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.135544,Process improvement,nanoparticles,zerovalent iron,manure,swine,,19,16,,,,,,
Life cycle assessment of sewage sludge pretreatment for biogas production: From laboratory tests to full-scale applicability,"In this work, different pretreatment technologies (low temperature thermal treatment, ultrasonication, alkali treatment, combined alkali-thermal treatment, icing-thawing) were investigated together with biochar addition to increase biogas yield from sewage sludge. The aim of the work was to develop a standardized protocol, including physicochemical characterization, biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests, digestate characterization, life cycle assessment (LCA) and economic analysis, to verify the techno-economic suitability and the related environmental impacts of upgrading conventional full-scale anaerobic digesters. Low-temperature (65-85 degrees C) thermal pretreatment showed the best performances in enhancing sludge solubilization and methane yield (up to 110%), followed by ultrasonication (up to 53%) and biochar addition (about 16%). The solubilization rate obtained after each pretreatment was similar for municipal and industrial sludge; however, it did not correspond to a proportional increase in methane yield.

The economic analysis proved that the high ultrasonication capital costs could not be recovered in the considered timeframe (15 yr), while biochar price should be significantly lowered (down to 6.5 (sic)/ton) to give an overall positive outcome.

Conversion of rubber wood waste to methane by ethanol organosolv pretreatment,"The restricted bioavailability of structurally complex carbohydrates for digestion has hitherto resulted in a low methane potential from rubber wood waste (RW). The effects of hydrothermal (HT) and ethanol organosolv (OS) pretreatments on the methane produced by anaerobic digestion of RW were investigated in the study reported. HT with temperatures above 190 degrees C significantly enhanced the anaerobic digestibility of RW mainly due to the degradation of hemicellulose. On the other hand, OS with 75% ethanol provided a potential methane gas yield of 165.1 L CH4/kg-VS, which was higher than that for HT at 210 and 230 degrees C by 39 and 7%, respectively. This was due to intensive delignification during OS pretreatment which led to a reduction in the non-productive adsorption of cellulolytic enzymes by lignin. A first-order kinetic model showed that OS had a higher hydrolysis rate (k = 0.073 +/- 0.003 day(-1)) resulting in a higher methane yield when lower pretreatment temperatures were applied. The anaerobic degradation of the pretreated RW in this study was a result of simultaneous CH4 production through the symbiosis of anaerobic bacteria and methanogens using a combination of the aceticlastic and hydrogenothrophic bioconversion pathways. The recovery and use of the phenolic compounds remaining in the process water would be a way of adding value to this process and the feasibility of producing methane from RW should be further investigated.","Tongbuekeaw, T; Sawangkeaw, R; Chaiprapat, S; Charnnok, B",Ethanol organosolv pretreatment; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Methane; Anaerobic digestion; Rubber wood waste,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13399-020-00710-4,Chemical,solvent,organosolv ethanol,wood,woodchips,rubberwood,,91,,,,44,8,31

Process assessment associated to microbial community response provides insight on possible mechanism of waste activated sludge digestion under typical chemical pretreatments,"Current studies have employed various chemicals for disintegrating and hydrolyzing microbial cells in waste activated sludge (WAS). However, a comprehensive process assessment over the whole anaerobic digestion process has seldom been proposed. Besides, the characterization of microbial community responses to these chemicals is not well understood. In this study, the effects of five typical chemicals: solubilizer (beta-cyclodextrin, CD), alkaline (NaOH), peroxide (peracetic-acid, PA), biological (rhamnolipid, RL) and chemical (sodium dodecylsulphate, SDS) surfactants on WAS digestion were examined. Higher efficiencies of WAS solubilization, hydrolysis and acidification were achieved by CD treatment, followed by RL and SDS. Methanogenesis was also strongly chemicals-dependent. Shifts in microbial community structure were observed in all chemical-pretreated WAS. The community in RI, CD and PA was dominated by microorganisms that anaerobically hydrolyze organics to acids, while that in NaOH and SDS was mainly associated to biogas production. This study proved that the overall performance of WAS digestion was substantially depended on the initial chemical pretreatments, which in turn influenced and was related to the microbial community structures. Although the economic advantage might not be clear yet, the findings obtained. in this work may provide a scientific basis for the potential implementation of chemicals for WAS treatment.

Understanding the role of mechanical pretreatment before anaerobic digestion: Lab-scale investigations,"Three successive mechanical pretreatments were applied at lab-scale in order to mimic the main functions of industrial mechanical pretreatments used for feedstock preparation in anaerobic digestion: particle size reduction (shredding), homogenization (mixing) and fiber alteration (blending). In parallel, full-scale mechanical devices have been investigated (two hammer mills and one chain mill). A physical and biochemical characterization was undertaken before and after each pretreatment. The results at lab scale revealed that shredding reduced the size of coarse particles, smoothly increased solubilisation but did not affect much the methane yield. Mixing further improved the solubilisation and the water retention capacity of the investigated products. The most important effect was the improvement of the methane production rate rather than the methane yield.

Anaerobic digestion of hazelnut (Corylus colurna) husks after alkaline pretreatment and determination of new important points in Logistic model curves,"In this study, anaerobic digestion (AD) of hazelnut (Corylus colurna) husks (HH) was investigated by NaOH pretreatment at 1-6% w/w concentrations. The highest methane yield was 278.45 +/- 7.85 mL/g volatile solid (VS), and this was obtained in a 4% NaOH pretreated reactor. In this reactor, the methane yield increased by 162.2% compared to that in the control. The concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) varied during the digestion process according to the different NaOH pretreatment results. The highest lignosellulosic solubilizations were obtained in a 6% NaOH pretreated reactor. Furthermore, in the second part of kinetic studies, it was defined critical points for cumulative methane yield (CMY) in the Logistic model (LM). These points were the absolute acceleration point (PAA), maximum acceleration point (PAM), inflection point (PI), maximum deceleration point (PDM), and asymptotic deceleration point (PDA). Using these points on the CMY curves, the AD process of HH was mathematically interpreted and explained.","Senol, H",Methane; Anaerobic digestion; Hazelnut husk; Alkaline pretreatment; Logistic model; Critical points,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.122660,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,lignocellulose,hazelnut,husk,86,77,,,,,,
Electrochemical pretreatment of waste activated sludge: effect of process conditions on sludge disintegration degree and methane production,"Waste activated sludge (WAS) requires a long digestion time because of a rate-limiting hydrolysis step - the first phase of anaerobic digestion (AD). Pretreatment can be used prior to AD to facilitate the hydrolysis step and improve the efficiency of WAS digestion. This study evaluated a novel application of electrochemical (EC) technology employed as the pretreatment method prior to AD of WAS, focusing on the effect of process conditions on sludge disintegration and subsequent AD process. A superior process condition of EC pretreatment was obtained by reaction time of 30min, electrolysis voltage of 20V, and electrode distance of 5cm, under which the disintegration degree of WAS ranged between 9.02% and 9.72%. In the subsequent batch AD tests, 206mL/g volatile solid (VS) methane production in EC pretreated sludge was obtained, which was 20.47% higher than that of unpretreated sludge. The AD time was 19 days shorter for EC pretreated sludge compared to the unpretreated sludge. Additionally, the EC+AD reactor achieved 41.84% of VS removal at the end of AD. The analysis of energy consumption showed that EC pretreatment could be effective in enhancing sludge AD with reduced energy consumption when compared to other pretreatment methods.","Ye, CH; Yuan, HP; Dai, XH; Lou, ZY; Zhu, NW",Waste activated sludge; electrochemical pretreatment; anaerobic digestion; methane production; VS removal,2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2016.1170209,Physical,electrolysis,,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Series of Combined Pretreatment Can Affect the Solubilization of Waste-Activated Sludge,"Various pretreatment methods have been combined and employed for maximizing the solubilization of waste-activated sludge (WAS).

Then, pretreatment conditions that caused similar solubilization (13.0%) (120 degrees C, pH 11, and 30 min for T, A, and U, respectively), were adopted for CP with reverse sequences of T&A, U&A, and T&U.

The difference in pretreatment series also affected the characteristics of soluble matters, which was analyzed by excitation emission matrix and molecular weight distribution.

Occurrence and fate of antimicrobial triclocarban and its transformation products in municipal sludge during advanced anaerobic digestion using microwave pretreatment,"This study, for the first time, investigated the impact of microwave pretreatment on the fate of the pervasive antimicrobial triclocarban (TCC) that was already present in municipal sludge, before and during advanced anaerobic digestion (AD) under thermophilic and mesophilic conditions. A range of microwave temperature (80 and 160 degrees C) and exposure duration (1 and 30 min) configurations were studied by employing ten bench-scale anaerobic digesters fed with mixed sludge at three different solids retention times (SRTs) including 20, 12, and 6 days. Seasonal changes influenced the levels of TCC in municipal sludge sampled from a plant employing the biological nutrient removal. Initial batch pretreatment studies showed that microwave irradiation itself can achieve TCC removal efficiencies up to 30 +/- 4 and 64 +/- 5% at 80 and 160 degrees C, respectively. The control digesters utilizing un-pretreated mixed sludge showed limited TCC removals, between 18 and 32% and 11-26% respectively, under thermophilic and mesophilic temperatures. On the other hand, the highest TCC elimination (78 +/- 2%) was obtained from the thermophilic digester utilizing microwaved sludge at 160 degrees C for 30 min at SRT of 12 days. The non-chlorinated carbanilide (a transformation product of TCC) was detected and quantified for the first time during conventional and microwave-pretreated anaerobic sludge digestion. The formation of carbanilide in biosolids through reductive dechlorination could be an indicator of efficient and complete TCC transformation. This research demonstrated that AD coupled with microwave pretreatment can be used to reduce environmental concentrations of TCC in municipal sludge and biosolids. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Biological pretreatment with Trametes versicolor to enhance methane production from lignocellulosic biomass: A metagenomic approach,"The presence of poorly biodegradable components in lignocellulosic biomass limits the methane recovery in anaerobic digesters. The main reason to go for aerobic pretreatment before anaerobic digestion (AD) is to enable enzymatic cleavage of the aromatic rings in lignin by oxygen since it cannot be efficiently degraded under anaerobic conditions.

The anaerobic digestion of biologically and physicochemically pretreated oily wastewater,"To enhance the degradation of oily wastewater and its biogas production, a biological-physicochemical pretreatment was introduced prior to the anaerobic digestion system. The digestion thereafter proceeded more efficiently due to the inoculation by oil degrading bacteria (Bacillus). A 2-stage pre-mixing is more effective than directly mixing. The effects on the methane production were also investigated by pre-treatment with ultrasonic (US) treatment, combined with citric acid (CA) addition. US pre-treatment was found to improve the initial methane production, and CA pre-treatment could maintain this improvement during the whole digestion stage. Pre-mixing Bacillus at 9 wt.% inoculation, combined with US for 10 min and a CA concentration of 500 mg/L provided the optimum conditions. The most effective enhancement of methane yield was 1100.46 ml/g VS, exceeding that of the control by 280%.

"Enhancing methane production of anaerobic sludge digestion by microaeration: Enzyme activity stimulation, semi-continuous reactor validation and microbial community analysis","Effects of microaeration pretreatment on sludge hydrolysis, biogas production and microbial community structure in anaerobic digestion (AD) were investigated by bench-scale tests and semi-continuous experiments. Bench tests showed that microaeration led to the release of dissolved organic matters, generation of volatile fatty acids and stimulation of enzyme activity. Correlation analysis showed that methane production was significantly correlated with the activity of a-glucosidase at 0.01 level, and with protease activity, released polysaccharides and VFAs at 0.05 level. Semi-continuous experiments showed that microaeration accelerated the utilization of organic matters, increased biogas production by 16.4%, enhanced methane content in biogas, and improved sludge dewaterability. Microbial community structure analysis showed that microaeration promoted enrichment of hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria in AD reactor rather than methanogenic bacteria, and aceticlastic methanogenesis was the main methanogenic pathway for methane production.","Ruan, DN; Zhou, Z; Pang, HJ; Yao, J; Chen, G; Qiu, Z",Micro-aeration pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Methane yield; Enzyme activity; Microbial community,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.121643,Biological,aerobic,microaerobic,activated sludge,mixed sludge,,,,,,,,,
"Improvement of Anaerobic Digestion of Sewage Sludge, Using Combined Hydrogen Peroxide and Thermal Pre-Treatment","The present study investigates the influence of individual and combined hydrogen peroxide and thermal pre-treatment of waste activated sludge on anaerobic digestion. For so doing, it employs anaerobic batch reactors in the mesophilic conditions.

Hydrogen peroxide pre-treatment has been tested in two concentrations of 30 g H2O2/kg VS and 60 g H2O2/kg VS and thermal pre-treatment has been performed at two temperatures of 75 degrees C and 90 degrees C. According to the results, the solubalisation of organic matter considerably improves, when combined hydrogen peroxide and thermal pretreatment is employed. As a result, in comparison to the control reactor, higher amounts of biogas (71%) and methane (81%) have been produced in the bioreactor, pre-treated with combined hydrogen peroxide (30 g H2O2/kg VS) and heat (90 degrees C). In addition, the removal efficiency of COD and VS from the digested sludge has been enhanced in the pre-treated reactors (up to 39% and 92%, respectively) in comparison to the control reactor. The improved methane yield, COD, and VS are of paramount importance, not only because higher amounts of renewable energy are obtained from the anaerobic digestion process, but because sludge transport costs are reduced and the digested sludge obtains a higher potential application to agricultural lands.","Hallaji, SM; Siami, S; Aminzadeh, B",Anaerobic digestion; waste activated sludge; hydrogen peroxide; thermal pretreatment; methane production,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.22059/poll.2018.260122.462,Chemical,oxidizer,peroxide h2o2,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,

The pretreatments were carried out with different NaOH solutions (2-8% w/w) at three temperatures (35, 55 and 121 degrees C) for different periods of time (24, 24 and 1 h). All treated and untreated Pennisetum Hybrid were digested under mesophilic conditions (37 degrees C) to biogas, significant effects of the pretreatments on the yield of methane were observed. Results showed the modified Gompertz equation was reliable (determination coefficients (R-2) greater than 0.96) to describe the kinetic behavior of anaerobic digestion of Pennisetum Hybrid. The best result, obtained by the treatment at 35 degrees C 2% NaOH for 24 h, resulted in the methane yield of 301.7 mL/g VS, corresponding to 21.0% improvement in the methane yield. Compositional, SEM, XRD and FTIR analysis confirmed that lignin removal, structural modification and cellulose crystalline variation were responsible for the improvement.","Kang, XH; Sun, YM; Li, LH; Kong, XY; Yuan, ZH",Pennisetum hybrid; Anaerobic digestion; Alkaline pretreatment; Structure changes; Specific methane yield,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.12.001,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,lignocellulose,Pennisetum,plant,,,,,,33,20,18
Enhanced mesophilic anaerobic digestion of food waste by thermal pretreatment: Substrate versus digestate heating,"Food waste (FW) represents a source of high potential renewable energy if properly treated with anaerobic digestion (AD). Pretreating the substrates could yield a higher biomethane production in a shorter time. In this study, the effects of thermal (heating the FW in a separate chamber) and thermophilic (heating the full reactor content containing both FW and inoculum) pretreatments at 50, 60, 70 and 80 degrees C prior to mesophilic AD were studied through a series of batch experiments. Pretreatments at a. lower temperature (50 degrees C) and a shorter time (<12 h) had a positive effect on the AD process. The highest enhancement of the biomethane production with an increase by 44-46% was achieved with a thermophilic pretreatment at 50 degrees C for 6-12 h or a thermal pretreatment at 80 degrees C for 1.5 h. Thermophilic pretreatments at higher temperatures (>55 degrees C) and longer operating times (>12 h) yielded higher soluble chemical oxygen demand (CODs), but had a negative effect on the methanogenic activity. The thermal pretreatments at the same conditions resulted in a lower solubilization of COD. Based on net energy calculations, the enhanced biomethane production is sufficient to heat up the FW for the thermal, but not for the thermophilic pretreatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The produced MPs with a molecular weight of 1220, 6835, and even 21,200,000 Da were confirmed by SEC-HPLC. Unexpectedly, MPs were found to be electroactive with higher redox peak values than that of humic acids, which were almost not degraded by anaerobes as revealed by SEC-HPLC and 3D-EEM spectra. For the first time, the results demonstrated that MPs delayed volatile fatty acids production and reduced the methane yield (22-26% lower), which was likely attributed to the toxicity and/or electrons competition with anaerobes such as Methanosaeta.

Effect of Aqueous Ammonia Soaking on the Methane Yield and Composition of Digested Manure Fibers Applying Different Ammonia Concentrations and Treatment Durations,"The continuously increasing demand for renewable energy sources renders anaerobic digestion one of the most promising technologies for renewable energy production. Due to the animal production intensification, manure is being used as the primary feedstock for most biogas plants. Thus, their economical profitable operation relies on increasing the methane yield from manure, and especially of its solid fraction which is not so easily degradable. In the present study, aqueous ammonia soaking (AAS) at six different concentrations in ammonia (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 32%) and for 1, 3 and 5 days at 22 C was applied on digested fibers separated from the effluent of a manure-fed, full-scale anaerobic digester. A methane yield increase from 76% to 104% was achieved during the first series of experiments, while the difference in reagent concentration did not considerably affect the methane yield. It was shown that the optimal duration was three days for both 5% and 25% w/w reagent concentrations in ammonia tested. Carbohydrates and phosphorus content remained unaffected, while a slight decrease in Klason lignin and non-soluble organic nitrogen content was observed after AAS. It is concluded that AAS is a very promising treatment resulting to an overall increase of the methane yield of digested manure fibers from 76% to 265% depending on the conditions and the batch of digested fibers used (an even higher increase of 190%-265% was achieved during the 2nd series of experiments, where different AAS durations were tested, compared to the 1st series were different ammonia concentrations were applied).","Mirtsou-Xanthopoulou, C; Jurado, E; Skiadas, IV; Gavala, HN",anaerobic digestion; aqueous ammonia soaking; digested manure fibers; methane potential; pretreatment,2014,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en7074157,Chemical,alkaline,aqueous ammonia soaking,manure,cow ,fibre part,,,,,,,,
Kinetics of thermophilic batch anaerobic digestion of thermal hydrolysed waste activated sludge,"Enhancing waste activated sludge (WAS) anaerobic digestion by thermal pretreatment has become of high interest. However, thermal treatment has been mainly combined to mesophilic anaerobic digestion. This paper presents the combination of sludge thermal pretreatment (110, 165 and 220 Q and batch thermophilic anaerobic digestion (55 degrees C). Optimal conditions of thermal pretreatment were shown to be 165 degrees C, involving a chemical oxygen demand (COD) and volatile solids (VS) solubilisation of 18 and 15% and a biodegradability increase from 47 to 61%. Treatments at 165 C were carried out in electric and steam modes and no significant difference on the impact of heating mode oil sludge anaerobic biodegradability was observed. Moreover, it may be recommended not to carry Out Successive batch experiments to assess thermophilic BMP of sludge as accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFA), particularly propionate, and a decrease of VFA uptake rates may occur. However, thermal pretreatment at 165 C allowed the decrease of propionate accumulation and an higher methane production. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Improving single-and two-stage anaerobic digestion of source separated organics by hydrothermal pretreatment,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) on single- and two-stage anaerobic digestion (AD) of source separated organics (SSO). The single stage AD was conducted in a batch mode. For the two-stage AD, the first stage (acidogenic fermentation) was perfromed under the semi-continuous flow regime, while, the second stage (methanogenesis) was conducted in a batch condition. The HTP was applied either before or after the acidogenic fermentation stage of the two-stage AD process at a temperature and pressure of 170 degrees C and 115 psi for 30 min. Thermal hydrolysis of SSO resulted in 32% suspended solids reduction, which was more than that of the acidogenic fermentation process (16-22%). Of all the investigated scenarios, the implementation of the two-stage AD fed with thermally pretreated SSO revealed the highest degree of COD solubilization (36%) and VFAs production (19,700 mg/L). This scenario also resulted in an ultimate biomethane recovery of 314 mL/g TCODadded, which was 35% higher than that of the single-stage AD of raw SSO (232 mL/g TCODadded). Considering the outcomes of this research, the combined HTP/two-stage AD can be suggested as an effective technique for enhanced bioconversion of SSO.","Azizi, A; Koupaie, EH; Hafez, H; Elbeshbishy, E",Two-stage anaerobic digestion; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Acidogenic fermentation; Solubilization; Biomethane; Source separated organics,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2019.05.001,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,ofmsw,source separated organics,,6.5,4.7,,,,,,

"Lignocellulose degradation, biogas production and characteristics of the microbial community in solid-state anaerobic digestion of wheat straw waste","Waste recycling is pivotal for deep space exploration or space habitation in life support systems (LSS) to enhance the material closure. This study investigated the enzymatic pretreatment and solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD) of wheat straw as the major component of biomass waste in LSS for resource reclamation. Wheat straw compounds, such as cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin were significantly degraded after pretreatment with degradation at 37.47%, 46.96%, and 14.05%, respectively. SS-AD with the C/N ratio of 25 resulted in more intense lignocellulose degradation (74.20%) and more biogas yield (77.59 L/kg volatile solid) with 30 days digestion. The microbial community variation and diversity were analyzed that common fiber-degrading bacteria including Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were dominant while the composition of the microbial genera shifted along with the digestion time. Moreover, a potential feasible strategy for biomass waste management in LSS by SS-AD was proposed.","Jin, XD; Ai, WD; Dong, WY",Wheat straw; Enzymatic pretreatment; Solid-state anaerobic digestion; Life support systems,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lssr.2021.09.004,Biological,enzyme,,lignocellulose,wheat,straw,90,85.5,43,0.92,46.7391304347826,35,31,10
Enhanced methane production from waste activated sludge by potassium ferrate combined with ultrasound pretreatment,"This study explored the effect of potassium ferrate (PF) combined with ultrasound (US) pretreatment on methane generation from sludge by a series of experiments and simulations. Batch experiments showed that the pretreatment of PF coupled with US exhibited positively synergy on the methane yield. And by the pretreatment of 0.05 g/g TSS (total suspended solids) PF cooperated with US (1 W/mL, 25 kHz, 15 min), the methane yield was enhanced from 180.62 +/- 3.26 to 228.83 +/- 4.76 mL/g VSS (volatile suspended solids). Mechanism studies confirmed that the co-pretreatment of PF and US efficiently promoted sludge disintegration, and the biodegradability of sludge organics was obviously enhanced. Microbial community analysis showed that the functional microorganisms participating in sludge anaerobic digestion were enriched by PF cooperated with US pretreatment, with the total abundance enhanced from 12.96% in the control to 17.96% in PF + US pretreated reactor.","Guo, B; Hu, JW; Zhang, JS; Wu, ZG; Li, Z",&nbsp; Potassium ferrate; Ultrasound pretreatment; Methane; Anaerobic digestion; Wasted activated sludge,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.125841,Chemical,oxidizer,K2FeO4,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,

Enhancing degradation and biogas production during anaerobic digestion of food waste using alkali pretreatment,"Alkali pretreatment of anaerobic digestion (AD) was investigated as a strategy to degrade complex organic matter such as fats. AD of food waste (FW) with alkali pretreatment was conducted using batch assays and long-term experiments for 70 days in two reactors. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of alkali pretreatment on solubilization and biogas production and to evaluate the performance in reactors with that of the untreated FW. The alkali pretreatment enhanced the solubilization of organic matter. The best biogas yield (829 mL/g VS) and methane content (65.48%) were obtained by the pretreatment with 1% CaO with the highest P-i,P- n (66.06%) of biodegradable soluble materials. The long-term reactors with pretreatment performed more steadily with higher biogas production under organic loading rates (OLR) over 5 g VS/(L.d). The bacterial community structure was different under various conditions. Methanosaeta and Methanospirillum were the dominant archaea in this study, while Methanosaeta increased in R1 at OLR of 6 g VS/(L.d). The study concluded that alkali pretreatment with 1% CaO appeared as a potential strategy for AD of FW.","Chen, LY; Qin, YJ; Chen, BQ; Wu, CL; Zheng, SH; Chen, RL; Yang, SH; Yang, L; Liu, ZJ",Food waste; Alkali pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; CaO additive; Organic loading rate,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109743,Chemical,alkaline,,food waste,canteen,,23,20,,,20,,,

Comparison of Initial pH Adjustment Prior to Thermophilic Anaerobic Digestion of Lime-Treated Corn Stover via Liquid Digestate or CO2,"Neutralization with liquid digestate and CO2 was compared herein to adjust the pH of lime-treated corn stover. The effects on the thermophilic (55 & DEG;C) anaerobic digestion were also analyzed. Liquid digestate neutralization (LDN) caused a decrease in pH from 10.5 to 7.5 in 60 h and accumulation of acetic/isobutyric acids. The CO2 neutralization (CN) under solid-state conditions reduced the pH from 10.5 to 8.5 in 30 min, which is faster than that of LDN and did not affect the subsequent anaerobic digestion. Biomethane production rate indicates that LDN contributed to the performance of anaerobic digestion, but this was not sufficient to compensate for the loss of total biomethane yield, resulting in a negative net profit (i.e., revenue from increased energy production minus reagent cost). For CN under solid-state conditions, the biomethane production was highest in both liquid- and solid-state anaerobic digestion, and also obtained a net profit of 98.74-100.89 RMB/tonne dry biomass. Therefore, the solid-state condition CN is a more efficient and economic method for adjusting initial pH of lime-treated corn stover.","Xiao, L; Yang, M; Hu, D; Mei, YX; Zhao, SM; Liang, YX",thermophilic anaerobic digestion; liquid digestate; carbon dioxide; lime pretreatment; corn stover,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app112210884,Chemical,alkaline,cao,lignocellulose,corn,stover,91,85,,,42,34,26,19
A biorefinery for the valorization of marigold (Calendula officinalis) residues to produce biogas and phenolic compounds,"Marigold (Calendula officinalis) market is focused on the extraction of compounds from the flower for homeopathic applications. However, most of the body plant is left as waste for final disposition. This work aims to show an integral valorization of leaves and stem of marigold to produce biogas and phenolic compounds such as vanillin and vanillic acid in a biorefinery scheme. An alkaline pretreatment was carried out to obtain black liquor and to favor the digestibility of the solid residue. The black liquor was oxidized in a high-pressure reactor, reaching experimental yields of 5.09% and 1.16% (based on lignin) for vanillin and vanillic acid, respectively. The remaining solid fraction was fermented through anaerobic digestion, achieving biogas productivity of 1621.3 mL/g of volatile solids. Afterward, these experimental results were used as input parameters to simulate and analyze a potential biorefinery. It was demonstrated that the anaerobic digestion stage affects up to 59% of the capital costs and that the positive economic gains were achieved at flow rates greater than 6.64 ton/h.

Volatile Fatty Acid Production Using Heat-Treated Potato Starch: Impact of Hydraulic Retention Time,"Potato starch was thermally pretreated and the effect of its solubilization on the production of volatile fatty acids (VFA) using mesophilic anaerobic digestion was investigated in this study. Potato starch with three concentrations (10, 15, and 25 g/L) was pretreated at 50 degrees C, 70 degrees C, 80 degrees C, 100 degrees C, 120 degrees C, and 140 degrees C to establish the relationship between temperature and degree of solubilization yielding a linear relationship (R-2=0.93-0.98) irrespective of the starch concentration. Anaerobic respirometric studies were performed with raw starch and starches pretreated at 100 degrees C (THP_100) and 140 degrees C (THP_140). The batch reactors were operated in parallel at hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 0.5, 1, and 2 days and organic loading rates (OLRs) of 6 and 9 kg-COD/(m(3).day).

Liquid hot water pretreatment to enhance the anaerobic digestion of wheat straw-effects of temperature and retention time,"Wheat straw is an abundant agricultural waste that is rich in lignocellulose. However, its waxy surface, highly crystallized structure, and limited surface area make it difficult to be hydrolyzed and used efficiently by microorganisms. Liquid hot water (LHW) pretreatment was studied to explore the feasibility of improving the methane yield of wheat straw in anaerobic digestion (AD). The results showed that the crosslinking structure of wheat straw was broken by LHW pretreatment. Some pores and cracks appeared on the surface of the pretreated wheat straw, increasing the microbial attachment sites. Under different hydrothermal temperatures (150-225 degrees C) and retention times (5-60 min), the degradation of hemicellulose ranged from 27.69 to 99.07%. The maximum methane yield (201.81 mL CH4/g volatile solids) was achieved after LHWpretreatment at 175 degrees C for 30 min, which was a 62.9% increase compared with non-treated straw. LHW at high temperatures such as 225 degrees C was not suitable for the AD of wheat straw. Methane yield results were fitted with the first-order and modified Gompertz equations to evaluate the hydrolysis rate and inhibitory effects of the pretreated materials in AD.","Shang, GY; Zhang, CG; Wang, F; Qiu, L; Guo, XH; Xu, FQ",Liquid hot water (LHW) pretreatment; Wheat straw; Anaerobic digestion; Kinetics model,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-06111-z,Physical,thermal,hot water,lignocellulose,wheat,straw,,,,,,,,
Evaluation of methane yield using acidogenic effluent of NaOH pretreated corn stover in anaerobic digestion,"This study explored the role of VFAs and ethanol production on daily biogas and methane yield of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pretreated corn stover (CS) in acidogenic and methanogenic phases during anaerobic digestion. The results from batch experiments revealed that the average methane and CO2 contents produced from NaOH pretreated CS were 53% and 38%, respectively. The concentration of VFAs and ethanol were over 17 g L-1 in the acidogenic phase, which were further converted into biogas in methanogenic phase. More specifically, the initially formed acetic, butyric and propionic acids were transformed into methane and CO2 in two different stages of methanogenic phase. On the other hand, two pretreatment regimes (NaOH pretreated CS and acidogenic effluent of NaOH pretreated CS) at the same organic loading rate were studied in continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTR). The methane and biogas yields obtained from acidogenic effluent of NaOH pretreated CS were 335 ml g.VS-1 and 548 ml g.VS-1; these values were 63.4% and 37.4%, respectively higher than the yields from NaOH pretreated CS sample. The results showed that sample from acidogenic effluent of NaOH pretreated CS improved methane production and maintained good system operation stability.

"Evaluation of thermal, ultrasonic and alkali pretreatments on mixed-microalgal biomass to enhance anaerobic methane production","Anaerobic digestion was regarded as one of the ways to recover energy from mixed-microalgae biomass in this study. After applying thermal-, ultrasonic-, and alkali-pretreatments to raw microalgae biomass to promote the digestion efficiency, a biochemical methane potential was investigated to evaluate the effectiveness of the pre-treatments for the purpose. As the pretreatment intensity increased, the solubilization of the mixed microalgae increased. However, the increased solubilization was not followed proportionally by the increased methane production. The highest methane productivity was achieved by the thermal-pretreatment at 120 degrees C (405 mL CH4/g-VS), which was 1.2 times higher than that of the non-pretreatment condition (336 mL CH4/g-VS). The net energy analysis revealed that only the pretreatment adjusted to pH 9 yielded a slightly higher energy gains (12.8 kJ/g-VS) than that of non-pretreatment condition (11.9 kJ/g-VS).

Studies on anaerobic digestion mechanism: Influence of pretreatment temperature on biodegradation of waste activated sludge,"The effect of thermal pretreatment on hydrolysis, acidogenesis and methanogenesis during anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge (WAS) was investigated. Pretreatment temperature of WAS ranged from 60 degrees C to 120 degrees C and the holding times were 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes. WAS was fed into the laboratory-scale anaerobic digesters, after thermal pretreatment. The preliminary conversion step (such as death/lysis of cell and hydrolysis of WAS) was promoted through thermal pretreatment, and consequently efficiencies of acidogenic and methanogenic steps were also markedly enhanced. Thermal pretreatment at lower temperature resulted in a significant increase in methane generation and destruction of organic matter. At 60 degrees C, when hydraulic retention time (HRT) was 8 days, an increase in approximately 52.1 % in methane generation (ml. l(-1).d(-1)) and 26.6% in organic matter destruction was achieved (Series-I). In addition, HRT necessary for anaerobic digestion could be reduced by thermal pretreatment.","Wang, Q; Noguchi, C; Hara, Y; Sharon, C; Kakimoto, K; Kato, Y",anaerobic digestion; hydraulic retention time; temperature; thermal pretreatment; waste activated sludge,1997,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593331808616619,Physical,thermal,,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
EFFICACY OF HYDROLYTIC ENZYME AUGMENTATION AND THERMOCHEMICAL PRETREATMENTS FOR INCREASED SECONDARY ANAEROBIC-DIGESTION OF TREATED MUNICIPAL SEWAGE SLUDGES,"Rising costs for landfill disposal of municipal sewage residues have prompted evaluation of alternative methods for reducing the bulk of the final waste. Representative samples of municipal sewage sludge residues were obtained from three major treatment plants in the United States, including Los Angeles (Hyperion), Denver (North Metro), and Chicago (Stickney). The majority of the treated, de-watered sewage sludge solids was found to be volatile (50-60%) and, presumably, biodegradable. Additionally, much of the volatile content was solubilized by both acid detergent fiber and neutral detergent fiber treatments, and was presumed to be proteineous microbial biomass in nature. Both low- and high-solids anaerobic digester systems, as well as the standard biochemical methane potential (BMP) assay, were utilized to evaluate the anaerobic digestibility of these sewage sludge residues.

Fungal pretreatment parameters for improving methane generation from anaerobic digestion of corn silage,"Corn silage was treated by white rot fungi (WRF) to investigate the effect of pretreatment on material's ability to produce methane in anaerobic digestion (AD). The selective fungi Pleurotus ostreatus and Dichomitus squalens promoted biogas generation, whereas the non-selective Trametes versicolor and Irpex lacteus had negative effect. Cumulative methane production after 10-day pretreatment with P. ostreatus at 28 degrees C rose 1.55-fold. The longer pretreatments of 30 and 60-days had smaller effect. When the pretreatment with P. ostreatus was carried out at 40 degrees C a high H2S release affected the AD process. Effect of WRF action dependent on the type of corn silage. With typical corn silage, the lignin depolymerisation raised the methane generation from 0.301 to 0.465 m(3) kg vs(-1). In contrast, extensive decomposition of hemicellulose in hybrid corn silage deteriorated the effect of pretreatment on methane production.","Basinas, P; Rusin, J; Chamradova, K; Malachova, K; Rybkova, Z; Novotny, C",Anaerobic digestion; Corn silage; Biological pretreatment; White rot fungi; Pleurotus ostreatus,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.126526,Biological,fungi,white rot,lignocellulose,corn,sillage,,,,,,,,
Klebsiella pneumoniae sp LZU10 degrades oil in food waste and enhances methane production from co-digestion of food waste and straw,"High content of lipid in food waste (FW) often causes inhibition on anaerobic digestion (AD) and methane production. To facilitate the transformation of oily FW to biogas, a bacterial strain Klebsiella pneumoniae sp. LZU10 (hereafter LZU10) which could degrade waste cooking oil to soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) was isolated from restaurant FW-contaminated soil. The strain also demonstrated high resistance to heavy metals, whose level were found elevated in FW. Thus LZU10 was used to pretreat FW prior to anaerobic co-digestion (coAD) with straw. Results showed that after pretreatment by LZU10 the lipid content decreased from 59.6% to 39.5%, and sCOD increased by 25.03%. The methane production and methane recovery rate were increased by 41% and 58%, respectively, after pretreatment with LZU10, compared with those of untreated FW. The present study suggests that pretreatment of lipid-rich FW with lipolytic bacteria is a promising solution to reduce lipid inhibition and enhance methane production. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Effect of thermal and alkaline pretreatment of giant miscanthus and Chinese fountaingrass on biogas production,"Giant miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus) and Chinese fountaingrass (Pennisetum alopecuroides (L.) Spreng), cultivated for landscaping and soil conservation, are potential energy crops. The study investigated the effect of combined thermal and alkaline pretreatments on biogas production of these energy crops. The pretreatment included two types of alkali (6% CaO and 6% NaOH) at 22, 70 and 100 degrees C. The alkaline pretreatment resulted in a greater breakdown of the hemicellulose fraction, with CaO more effective than NaOH. Pretreatment of giant miscanthus with 6% CaO at 100 degrees C for 24 h produced a CH4 yield (313 mL g(-1) volatile solids (VS)) that was 1.7 times that of the untreated sample (186 mL g(-1) VS). However, pretreatment of Chinese fountaingrass with 6% CaO or 6% NaOH at 70 degrees C for 24 h resulted in similar CH4 yields (328 and 302 mL g(-1) VS for CaO and NaOH pretreatments) as the untreated sample (311 mL g(-1) VS). Chinese fountaingrass was more easily digestible but had a low overall CH4 yield per hectare (1,831 m(3) ha(-1) y(-1)) compared to giant miscanthus (6,868 m(3) ha(-1) y(-1)).

Sequential parametric optimization of methane production from different sources of forest raw material,"The increase in environmental problems and the shortage of fossil fuels have led to the need for action in the development of sustainable and renewable fuels. Methane IS produced through anaerobic digestion of organic materials and is a biofuel with very promising characteristics. The success in using methane as a biofuel has resulted in the operation of several commercial-scale plants and the need to exploit novel materials to be used. Forest biomass can serve as an excellent candidate for use as raw material for anaerobic digestion. During this work, both hardwood and softwood species which are representative of the forests of Sweden were used for the production of methane. Initially, when untreated forest materials were used for the anaerobic digestion, the yields obtained were very low, even with the addition of enzymes, reaching a maximum of only 40 mL CH4/g VS when birch was used. When hydrothermal pretreatment was applied, the enzymatic digestibility improved up to 6.7 times relative to that without pretreatment, and the yield of methane reached up to 254 mL CH4/g VS. Then the effect of chemical/enzymatic detoxification was examined, where laccase treatment improved the methane yield from the more harshly pretreated materials while it had no effect on the more mildly pretreated material. Finally, addition of cellulolytic enzymes during the digestion improved the methane yields from spruce and pine, whereas for birch separate saccharification was more beneficial. To achieve high yields in spruce 30 filter paper units (FPU)/g was necessary, whereas 15 FPU/g was enough when pine and birch were used. During this work, the highest methane yields obtained from pine and birch were 179.9 mL CH4/g VS and 304.8 mL CH4/g VS, respectively. For mildly and severely pretreated spruce, the methane yields reached 259.4 mL CH4/g VS and 276.3 mL CH4/g VS, respectively. We have shown that forest material can serve as raw material for efficient production of methane. The initially low yields from the untreated materials were significantly improved by the introduction of a hydrothermal pretreatment. Moreover, enzymatic detoxification was beneficial, but mainly for severely pretreated materials. Finally, enzymatic saccharification increased the methane yields even further.","Matsakas, L; Rova, U; Christakopoulos, P",anaerobic digestion; methane; spruce; pine; birch; hydrothermal pretreatment; enzymatic saccharification; detoxification,2015,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.01163,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,wood,forest residues,,,,,,,,,

Life Cycle Assessment of Two Alkaline Pretreatments of Sorghum and Miscanthus and of Their Batch Co-digestion with Cow Manure,"In the context of bioenergy production, sorghum and miscanthus are relevant candidates for biogas production. As for many lignocellulosic biomasses, pretreatments can improve the accessibility of carbohydrates for microorganisms during anaerobic digestion. The objectives of this study were (1) to assess environmental impacts of lime and soda pretreatments of both biomasses in co-digestion with manure and (2) to compare the heat produced from natural gas with heat produced from biomethane generated from whole plants of sorghum and miscanthus under different studied scenarios. A comprehensive attributional life cycle analysis (LCA) was performed on 21 sorghum scenarios and 12 miscanthus scenarios. Certain scenarios explored direct and indirect land use change (dLUC and iLUC). An environmental evaluation highlighted that most of the impacts are generated by crop production and by the purification and injection step for both sorghum and miscanthus. Compared to natural gas, the study emphasized that, unlike lime treatment, soda treatment does not provide an added value. Although most impacts are favourable towards natural gas, sorghum-based methane presents very good results (below 0) for six impact categories. The reduction of climate change ranges from - 90 to - 105%. Miscanthus can reduce climate change by - 60 to - 80%, but almost all other impact categories are in favour of natural gas.

Synergistic Co-Digestion of Microalgae and Primary Sludge to Enhance Methane Yield from Temperature-Phased Anaerobic Digestion,"A two-stage temperature-phased mesophilic anaerobic digestion assay was carried out to study the interaction between various biological pretreatment conditions and the possible synergistic co-digestion of microalgae and primary sludge. The study of growth kinetics of the biochemical methane potential test revealed that a maximum of 36% increase in methane yield was observed from co-digestion of a substrate pretreated by thermophilic aerobic conditions (55 degrees C and HRT = 2 days) and an 8.3% increase was obtained from the anaerobic pretreated substrate (55 degrees C and HRT = 3 days). Moreover, no synergistic effects on methane yields were observed in co-digesting the substrate pretreated with high temperature (85 degrees C). The study also identified specific conditions in which interaction between biological pretreatment and co-digestion might substantially reduce methane yield. Careful optimization of operating conditions, both aerobic and anaerobic pretreatment at moderate thermophilic conditions, can be used as a biological pretreatment to enhance methane yield from the co-digestion of microalgae and primary sludge.","Damtie, MM; Shin, J; Jang, HM; Kim, YM",anaerobic digestion; co-digestion; microalgae; primary sludge; biological pretreatment; methane yield,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en13174547,Physical,thermal,,codigestion,microalgae+primary sludge,,,,,,,,,
Steam Explosion Pretreatment of Sludge for Pharmaceutical Removal and Heavy Metal Release to Improve Biodegradability and Biogas Production,"Steam explosion pretreatment was developed and evaluated to remove pharmaceuticals and heavy metals from wastewater sludge and to improve its biodegradability and methane yield. Effects of pressure (5-15 bar) and duration (1-15 min) during the pretreatment were examined, and the pretreatment efficiency was evaluated based on the solubilization degree, the capillary suction time (CST) test and anaerobic digestion. The removal efficiency of ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and amoxicillin was 65%, 69%, and 66% and 70%, 66%, and 70% in primary sludge (PS) and waste-activated sludge (WAS), respectively. The highest percent release efficiency of heavy metals, i.e., lead, cadmium, and silver, for PS and WAS was 78%, 70%, and 79% and 79%, 80%, and 75%, respectively. The highest methane yield was obtained after pretreatment at 10 bar for 15 min and at 15 bar for 10 min, with respective yields of 380 and 358 mL CH4/g volatile solids (VS) for the PS and 315 and 334 mL CH4/g VS for the WAS. The results of methane production indicated that the decreased concentrations of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals resulted in increased biodegradability of PS and WAS.","Aski, AL; Borghei, A; Zenouzi, A; Ashrafi, N; Taherzadeh, MJ",steam explosion pretreatment; heavy metals; pharmaceuticals; sludge; anaerobic digestion; methane yield,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation6010034,Physical,thermal,steam explosion,activated sludge,mixed sludge,,,,,,,,,
Enhancement of thermophilic anaerobic digestion of thickened waste activated sludge by combined microwave and alkaline pretreatment,"Pretreatment of thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS) by combined microwave and alkaline pretreatment (MAP) was studied to improve thermophilic anaerobic digestion efficiency. Uniform design was applied to determine the combination of target temperature (110-210 degrees C), microwave holding time (1-51 min), and NaOH dose (0-2.5 g NaOH/g suspended solids (SS)) in terms of their effect on volatile suspended solids (VSS) solubilization.

In spite of the increase in soluble chemical oxygen demand concentration and the decrease in dewaterability of digested sludge, a semi-continuous thermophilic reactor fed with pretreated TWAS without neutralization (at 170 degrees C with 1 min holding time and 0.05 g NaOH/g SS) was stable and functioned well, with volatile solid (VS) and total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) reductions of 28% and 18%, respectively, which were higher than those of the control system. Additionally, methane yields (L@STP/g-CODadded, at standard temperature and pressure (STP) conditions of 0 degrees C and 101.325 kPa) and (L@STP/g VSadded) increased by 17% and 13%, respectively, compared to the control reactor.","Chi, YZ; Li, YY; Fei, XN; Wang, SP; Yuan, HY",thickened waste activated sludge; microwave pretreatment; alkaline pretreatment; thermophilic anaerobic digestion,2011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(10)60561-X,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,activated sludge,thickened waste activated sludge,,4.5,3.4,,,,,,
Impact of thermal pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of dewatered sludge from municipal and industrial wastewaters and its economic feasibility,"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of thermal pretreatment on anaerobic digestion (AD) of dewatered sludge. Thermal pretreatment was conducted at varying temperatures (40-220 degrees C) and durations (1-3 h), prior to batch biomethane production. The highest biomethane yield of 195 mL CH4/g VSfeed was achieved at 140 degrees C for 3 h, which was 81% higher than that of the control. However, the net cash flow of 76,942 USD/yr was achieved at 60 degrees C for 3 h. The solubilization of chemical oxygen demand and cell lysis were accompanied by a relative abundance of Firmicutes in the bacterial population during batch digestion, implying that thermal pretreatment promoted the growth of hydrolytic bacteria. In the methanogenic archaeal population, the proportion of hydrogenotrophs and electrotrophs increased, indicating that pretreatment enhanced the interspecies transfer of H-2 and electrons. Economic analysis revealed that pretreatment at 40 degrees C for 1 h, 60 degrees C for 1-3 h and 100 degrees C for 3 h could be beneficial to AD of dewatered sludge. However, a sensitivity analysis confirmed that 60 degrees C for 3 h is the most economical pretreatment condition.

Insight into understanding the performance of electrochemical pretreatment on improving anaerobic biodegradability of yard waste,"Electrochemical pretreatment is considered a promising technique to reduce recalcitrance nature of lignocellulosic biomass. Yet, a comprehensive knowledge on the performance of alkaline reagents in electrochemical pretreatment and the associated environmental impacts are at an early stage. The present study investigated and compared the effect of electrochemical pretreatment by using NaOH reagent (EN) and electrochemical pretreatment by using Ca(OH)2 reagent (EC). The results showed that, both pretreatment techniques elicited the structural breakdown of the biomass, as evidenced by compositional changes, supernatant properties, SEM, FTIR, and XRD analyses. The batch anaerobic digestion results revealed that the improvement in methane production was highest for the EC pretreatment (434 mL/gVS) followed by the EN pretreatment (346 mL/gVS) and the untreated yard waste (245 mL/gVS). The Modified Gompertz model showed the best fit for untreated and pretreated yard waste. The results of economic analysis confirmed the highest net profit of 8922 rupees (US$ 119.29) for EC pretreatment. The findings of life cycle analysis revealed that the net environmental performance considering the inventory used and the limitations of the system boundary was highest for EC pretreatment followed by EN pretreatment and untreated condition.

Long-term monitoring of a thermal hydrolysis-anaerobic co-digestion plant treating high-strength organic wastes: Process performance and microbial community dynamics,"Two parallel anaerobic digesters (8500 m(3) capacity each), combined with thermal hydrolysis (TH) pretreatment, co-digesting dewatered sewage sludge, dewatered human feces, and food wastewater were monitored over a 12-month period from start-up to explore the feasibility of field application of the combined process. The waste mixtures before and after pretreatment and the feed and digestate of each digester were taken semimonthly (i.e., 48 samples in total) for analysis of the feed characteristics, process parameters, and digester microbial community structure. The TH pretreatment proved effective in improving the bioavailability of the waste mixture. The solubilization efficiency tended to increase with the particulate organic fraction in the raw mixture. Although fluctuations in the feed characteristics and loading significantly influenced the process and microbial behaviors, the digesters maintained stable performance during the study period. Our results demonstrate that the TH-anaerobic digestion process can achieve an effective and robust treatment of the waste mixture.","Choi, G; Kim, H; Lee, C",Anaerobic digestion; Full-scale monitoring; Microbial community structure; Pretreatment; Statistical analysis,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.124138,Physical,thermal,thermal hydrolysis,activated sludge,high strength organic sludge,,11.9,9.401,,,,,,
Evaluation of methane production and energy conversion from corn stalk using furfural wastewater pretreatment for whole slurry anaerobic co-digestion,"In this study, corn stalk (CS) was pretreated with furfural wastewater (FWW) for whole slurry anaerobic digestion (AD), which increased the degradability of CS components, changed the parameters in pretreatment slurry and improved the biochemical methane potential (BMP). The ultimate goal was to optimize the time and temperature for FWW pretreatment and evaluate whether FWW pretreatment is feasible from BMP and energy conversion. The results of path analysis suggested that lignocellulosic degradability (LD) was the main factor affecting methane production with the comprehensive decision of 0.7006. The highest BMP (166.34 mL/g VS) was achieved by the pretreatment at 35 degrees C for 6 days, which was 70.36% higher than that of control check (CK) (97.64 mL/g VS) and the optimal pretreatment condition was predicted at 40.69 degrees C for 6.49 days by response surface methodology (RSM). The net residual value (NRV) for the pretreatment of 35 degrees C and 6 days was the highest (0.6201), which was the most appropriate condition for AD in real application.","Wang, Z; Cheng, QS; Liu, ZY; Qu, JB; Chu, XD; Li, N; Noor, RS; Liu, CY; Qu, B; Sun, Y",Furfural wastewater pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Energy conversion; Corn stalk; Path analysis,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.121962,Biological,biological active substrate,furfural wastewater,lignocellulose,corn,stalk,92,86,43,0.49,87.7551020408163,,,
Energy balance and cost-benefit analysis of biogas production from perennial energy crops pretreated by wet oxidation,"Perennial crops need far less energy to plant, require less fertilizer and pesticides, and show a lower negative environmental impact compared with annual crops like for example corn. This makes the cultivation of perennial crops as energy crops more sustainable than the use of annual crops. The conversion into biogas in anaerobic digestion plants shows however much lower specific methane yields for the raw perennial crops like miscanthus and willow due to their lignocellulosic structure. Without pretreatment the net energy gain is therefore lower for the perennials than for corn. When applying wet oxidation to the perennial crops, however, the specific methane yield increases significantly and the ratio of energy output to input and of costs to benefit for the whole chain of biomass supply and conversion into biogas becomes higher than for corn. This will make the use of perennial crops as energy crops competitive to the use of corn and this combination will make the production of biogas from energy crops more sustainable.","Uellendahl, H; Wang, G; Moller, HB; Jorgensen, U; Skiadas, IV; Gavala, HN; Ahring, BK",anaerobic digestion; energy crops; lignocellulose; miscanthus; perennial crops; pretreatment; wet oxidation,2008,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2008.504,Chemical,oxidizer,wet oxidation,lignocellulose,miscanthus,plant,,,,,,,,
Integrated hydrothermal and deep eutectic solvent-mediated fractionation of lignocellulosic biocomponents for enhanced accessibility and efficient conversion in anaerobic digestion,"Effective fractionation of lignocellulosic biocomponents of lignocellulosic biomass can increase its utilization in anaerobic digestion for high yield biomethane production. A hydrothermal process was optimized and integrated with a deep eutectic solvent (DES) pretreatment to preferentially fractionate hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin in rice straw. The optimized hydrothermal process resulted in 96% hemicellulose solubilization at moderately low combined pretreatment severity (log S = 2.26), allowing increased hemicellulosic sugar recovery with minimal formation of inhibitory byproducts. Subsequent DES pretreatment resulted in highly bioaccessible cellulosic pulp, removing 81.3% of lignin that can be recovered and converted into value-added products. Anaerobic digestion of hemicellulosic fraction and cellulosic pulp using a microbial methanogenic consortium seed acclimatized to the lignocellulosic inhibitors resulted in a 33.4% higher yield of methane (467.84 mL g(-1) VSinitial) than with anaerobic digester sludge seed.

"A process combining hydrothermal pretreatment, anaerobic digestion and pyrolysis for sewage sludge dewatering and co-production of biogas and biochar: Pilot-scale verification","To fully dispose of/utilize sewage sludge, a process combing hydrothermal pretreatment (HTPT), anaerobic digestion (AD) and pyrolysis was developed and tested at the pilot scale. First, the improvement in sludge dewaterability by HTPT at 180 degrees C for 30 min was verified, and the water content decreased from 85 to 33 wt% after filter pressing. Then, the resulting filtrate underwent continuous mesophilic (37 +/- 2 degrees C) AD in an up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor for producing biogas to compensate for the energy required for HTPT. Meanwhile, the filter cake was pyrolyzed in a rotary furnace (600 +/- 50 degrees C) to generate biochar, and heavy metals were well immobilized in the biochar. Finally, the material/energy balance made according to the pilot data showed that the proposed process was effective for full resource reuse of sewage sludge.","Li, CX; Wang, XD; Zhang, GY; Li, J; Li, ZW; Yu, GW; Wang, Y",Sewage sludge; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Pyrolysis; Heavy metal; Energy balance,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.01.045,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,activated sludge,sewage sludge,,,,,,,,,
Construction of novel microbial consortia CS-5 and BC-4 valued for the degradation of catalpa sawdust and chlorophenols simultaneously with enhancing methane production,"This study might be the first to explore the novel constructed microbial consortia CS-5 and BC-4 for enhancing methane (CH4) production during anaerobic digestion (AD) with simultaneous degradation of catalpa sawdust and chlorophenols (CPs). Significant reduction in cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin contents was achieved after the biodegradation of catalpa sawdust for 15 days by CS-5 and BC-4, with a total weight loss of 69.2 and 56.3%, respectively. The synergistic microbial consortia enhanced cumulative biogas and CH4 yields by 76.3 and 64.3%, respectively higher than the corresponding control at the end of AD. More than 90% of CH4 was produced within 18 days of AD as a result of microbial pretreatment of catalpa sawdust. These consortia resulted in remarkably higher energy conversion efficiency of 44.3% (218.1 L-N CH4/kg TS) over the control.

Enhanced bioproduction of short-chain fatty acids from waste activated sludge by potassium ferrate pretreatment,"Recently, bioproduction of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) from waste activated sludge (WAS) has attracted much attention. Many pretreatment methods were investigated to improve the hydrolysis efficiency of WAS. However, studies on sludge pretreatment employing ferrate (VI) remain limited. Therefore, this literature explored how the potassium ferrate affects the SCFA production as well as the underlying correlation between the microbial community and the system performance. It was found that the ferrate pretreatment promoted the SCFA production significantly after 8 days' digestion from 475 mg COD/L of the control to 2835 mg COD/L at a dosage of 0.9 g/g. The analysis of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) showed that the extracted EPS had a positive linear relationship with the final SCFA production, which indicated that the extracted EPS could be adopted as an excellent indicator to reveal the pretreatment effect of this method. The concentrations of protein and carbohydrate both showed uptrends with the increasing dosage of potassium ferrate, whereas it imposed a negative impact on the phosphate concentration, which could be explained by precipitation of Fe ion and phosphate. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis showed that the biodiversity and population distribution evenness were reduced markedly and it further indicated that ferrate pretreatment enhanced the community function by giving rise to acid-producing bacteria, which was in accord with the observed SCFA yield.","Li, L; He, JG; Xin, XD; Wang, MF; Xu, J; Zhang, J",Municipal sludge; Anaerobic digestion; Sludge pretreatment; Extracellular polymeric substance; Microbial community,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2017.09.103,Chemical,oxidizer,K2FeO4,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Assessment of microbial viability in municipal sludge following ultrasound and microwave pretreatments and resulting impacts on the efficiency of anaerobic sludge digestion,"A range of ultrasonication (US) and microwave irradiation (MW) sludge pretreatments were compared to determine the extent of cellular destruction in micro-organisms within secondary sludge and how this cellular destruction translated to anaerobic digestion (AD). Cellular lysis/inactivation was measured using two microbial viability assays, (1) Syto 16A (R) Green and SytoxA (R) Orange counter-assay to discern the integrity of cellular membranes and (2) a fluorescein diacetate assay to understand relative enzymatic activity. A range of MW intensities (2.17-6.48 kJ/g total solids or TS, coinciding temperatures of 60-160 A degrees C) were selected for comparison via viability assays; a range of corresponding US intensities (2.37-27.71 kJ/g TS, coinciding sonication times of 10-60 min at different amplitudes) were also compared to this MW range. The MW pretreatment of thickened waste activated sludge (tWAS) caused fourfold to fivefold greater cell death than non-pretreated and US-pretreated tWAS. The greatest microbial destruction occurred at MW intensities greater than 2.62 kJ/g TS of sludge, after which increased energy input via MW did not appear to cause greater microbial death. In addition, the optimal MW pretreatment (80 A degrees C, 2.62 kJ/g TS) and corresponding US pretreatment (10 min, 60 % amplitude, 2.37 kJ/g TS) were administered to the tWAS of a mixed sludge and fed to anaerobic digesters over sludge retention times (SRTs) of 20, 14, and 7 days to compare effects of feed pretreatment on AD efficiency. The digester utilizing MW-pretreated tWAS (80 A degrees C, 2.62 kJ/g TS) had the greatest fecal coliform removal (73.4 and 69.8 % reduction, respectively), greatest solids removal (44.2 % TS reduction), and highest overall methane production (248.2 L CH4/kg volatile solids) at 14- and 7-day SRTs. However, despite the fourfold to fivefold increases in cell death upon pretreatment, improvements from the digester fed MW-pretreated sludge were marginal (i.e., increases in efficiency of less than 3-10 %) and likely due to a smaller proportion of cells (10-20 %) in the polymeric network and mixed sludge fed to digesters.","Cella, MA; Akgul, D; Eskicioglu, C",Anaerobic digestion; Sludge pretreatment; Microwave irradiation; Ultrasonication; Microbial viability; Municipal waste,2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-7139-3,Physical,ultrasonic,,activated sludge,mixed sludge,,,,,,,,,

Microbial Pretreatment of Corn Stovers by Solid-State Cultivation of Phanerochaete chrysosporium for Biogas Production,"The microbial pretreatment of corn stover and corn stover silage was achieved via the solid-state cultivation of Phanerochaete chrysosporium; pretreatment effects on the biodegradability and subsequent anaerobic production of biogas were investigated. The peak levels of daily biogas production and CH4 yield from corn stover silage were approximately twice that of corn stover. Results suggested that ensiling was a potential pretreatment method to stimulate biogas production from corn stover. Surface morphology and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses demonstrated that the microbial pretreatment of corn stover silage improved biogas production by 10.5 to 19.7 % and CH4 yield by 11.7 to 21.2 % because pretreatment could decrease dry mass loss (14.2 %) and increase substrate biodegradability (19.9 % cellulose, 32.4 % hemicellulose, and 22.6 % lignin). By contrast, the higher dry mass loss in corn stover (55.3 %) after microbial pretreatment was accompanied by 54.7 % cellulose, 64.0 % hemicellulose, and 61.1 % lignin degradation but did not significantly influence biogas production.","Liu, S; Wu, SB; Pang, CL; Li, W; Dong, RJ",Corn stover; Corn stover silage; Biological pretreatment; Phanerochaete chrysosporium; Anaerobic digestion,2014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-013-0604-5,Biological,fungi,Phanerochaete chrysosporium,lignocellulose,corn,stover,91.5,83.6,,,,45,27,8

At first, this study analyzed the impacts of acid/alkali pretreatments on wheat straw morphology, lignocellulosic components and evaluated these impacts on subsequent AD process by SEM, XRD, FT-IR and 3D-EEM analysis. The results of AD process showed that both acid and alkali pretreatments can enhance the hydrolytic performance of substrates. W12 (0.01 mol/L NaOH pretreated wheat straw mono-digestion) obtained the highest cumulative specific methane yield (CSMY) of 227.4 mL/g.VS. However, due to the formation of humic substances in liquid fraction, 0.1 mol/L NaOH pretreated wheat straw (W13) presented inhibition in converting propionic acid into acetic acid process. Co-digestion with sludge can relieve this inhibition and obtain the highest CSMY of 221.4 mL/g.VS. This study also exhibited the effects of pretreatments on microbial community and diversity: the inhibition of acetogens in AD process was revealed. Eventually, this study summarizes the positive and negative effects of acid/alkali pretreatments on the different digestive stages, aiming to provide references for future research and engineering implementation.

Pretreatment of wheat straw with potassium hydroxide for increasing enzymatic and microbial degradability,"The pretreatment of wheat straw with potassium hydroxide (KOH) at ambient temperature (20 degrees C) was investigated. The pretreatment effects on chemical composition and physical structures, and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion were evaluated. Wheat straw at 10% total solids (TS) was treated with KOH solution for 24 h at a wide range of KOH loadings from 2% to 50% (w/w dry basis). Higher KOH loading resulted in higher lignin reduction from the straw and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the resulting black liquor. Maximum lignin reduction of 54.7% was observed at 50% KOH loading. In comparison to untreated straw, specific hydrolysis yields achieved 14.0-92.3% over the range of 2-50% KOH loading, and methane yields increased 16.7-77.5% for KOH loadings of 10-50%, respectively. Accounting for losses during pretreatment, 20% KOH loading resulted in maximum overall reducing sugar yield and methane yield and therefore is the recommended loading for pretreatment under these conditions.

Effects of particle size on anaerobic digestion of food waste,The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of particle size reduction and solubilization on biogas production from food waste (FW) To clarify the effects of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in the digestion process the relationship between particle size and VFA accumulation was investigated in detail For this purpose substrates of various particle sizes were prepared by bead milling to support hydrolysis Batch anaerobic digestion experiments were carried out using these pretreated substrates at mesophilic temperature for a period of 16 days The results of pretreatment showed that the mean particle size (MPS) of substrates ground with a bead mill decreased from 0 843 to 0 391 mm and solubilization accounted for approximately 40% of the total chemical oxygen demand (total COD) for grinding pretreatment by bead milling Anaerobic digestion batch experiments revealed that MPS reduced by bead milling at 1000 rpm improved methane yield by 28% compared with disposer treatment Moreover this may have increased microbial degradation during the VFA production process with increasing total number of revolutions (operation time x revolutions per minute) However excessive reduction of the particle size of the substrate resulted in VFA accumulation decreased methane production and decreased solubilization in the anaerobic digestion process These results suggest that optimized reduction of the particle size of the substrate in conjunction with optimized microbial growth could improve the methane yield in anaerobic digestion processes (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved,"Izumi, K; Okishio, YK; Nagao, N; Niwa, C; Yamamoto, S; Toda, T",Anaerobic digestion; Methane; Particle size; Pretreatment; Food waste; Volatile fatty acids,2010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2010.06.013,Physical,mechanical desintegration,milling,food waste,food waste,standard,16.5,15.5,,,,,,
Effect of wheat straw pretreated with liquid fraction of digestate from different substrates on anaerobic digestion performance and microbial community characteristics,"The effects of liquid fraction of digestate (LFD) pretreatment on anaerobic digestion (AD) performance and microbial community characteristics were estimated. Prior to AD, LFD (LFDSM, LFDFW, and LFDWS) collected separately from three continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) using swine manure (SM), food waste (FW), and wheat straw (WS) as the mono-substrate was applied to pretreat WS. The results showed that AD with LFD pretreatment resulted in biomethane yields of 240.2-277.9 mL.gVS(-1), a 33.57%-54.54% improvement over the yield of the control, and also produced a time saving of 32.26%-46.77%. The pretreatment parameters were optimized for LFD pretreatment. The enhancement effect was in the order of LFDFW > LFDSM > LFDWS. Simultaneously, the cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin contents in the WS and their characteristics (surface properties, crystallinity index, etc.) varied accordingly. The function of the microbial community was strengthened during the pretreatment stage, but the structure of the microbial community had a clear response to the LFD source substrates. Bacteroidetes was the most dominant phyla and was positively correlated with the hydrolysis rate. Consequently, the LFD from the different substrates used as pretreat agents could improve the AD performance of WS. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Enhancement of biogas yield during anaerobic digestion of Jatropha curcas seed by pretreatment and co-digestion with mango peels,"The combustion of fossil fuels is accompanied with a number of alarming problems such as fossil fuel depletion, increase in their prices, and emission of greenhouse gases. Thus, the need for the alternative renewable biofuels was increased to replace non-renewable fossil fuels. The sustainable use of non-edible feedstocks and waste for production of biofuels is a potential approach for reducing dependency on fossil fuels and mitigating environmental pollution. In the current study, the effects of carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratios on methane yield during anaerobic co-digestion of Jatropha curcas de-oiled seed kernel and mango peels were evaluated in continuous reactors. The biogas potential and effects of acid pretreatment on J. curcas fruit were also evaluated during anaerobic batch digestion. The methane yield of co-digested mango peels and seed kernel (1:4 weight ratio based on volatile solids) was 61%, 50%, 36%, and 25% higher compared with the methane yields of mango peels, seed kernel, mango peels/seed kernel (2:1 w/w), and mango peels/seed kernel (1:1 w/w), respectively. The methane yields of the co-digestion of mango peels and seed kernel at 1:4, 1:1, and 2:1 ratios were 52%, 39%, and 32% of the theoretical yields, respectively, illustrating the importance of adjusting C/N ratio with the right amounts of co-substrate. The biogas yield of pretreated fruit coat was 7%, 22%, 34%, 50%, and 74% higher than that of the seed kernel, fruit coat (non-pretreated), de-oiled kernel plus seed coat (pretreated) (1.7:1, by weight), seed coat (pretreated), and seed coat (non-pretreated), respectively. Additionally, pretreatment of fruit coat and seed coat resulted in 22% and 47% higher biogas yields compared with their non-pretreated counterparts. This study revealed key substrate selection and pretreatment methods for increasing methane production from common seed oil production and agricultural wastes.","Haq, A; Khan, A; Haji, K; Khan, S; Shah, AA; Hasan, F; Ahmed, S; de los Reyes, FL; Badshah, M",Mono-digestion; Anaerobic digestion; Pretreatment; C/N ratio; Methane; Mango peels,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13399-020-01064-7,Chemical,acidic,,lignocellulose,Jatropha curcas,seed,,,,,,,,
Enhancement effect of ionizing radiation pretreatment on biogas production from anaerobic fermentation of food waste,"Anaerobic digestion has become an important technology in the treatment of food waste and the acquisition of renewable energy. However, the physicochemical properties of the fermentation substrate have a great influence on the fermentation process. The present study examined the use of radiation technology for the anaerobic digestion pretreatment of food waste. Food waste was irradiated with different doses of radiation from a Co-60 gamma source and then subjected to anaerobic digestion to produce biogas. The effects of ionizing radiation pretreatment on the dissolution of organics were also investigated. The results revealed that, for food waste that had been subjected to 8.28-kGy irradiation pretreatment, the soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) increased by 70.6% from 140.1 g/L to 239.1 g/L while the biogas yield was 504 ml/g VSadd, which was an increase of 14.3% over the non-irradiated pretreatment group. Therefore, radiation technology is a novel and efficient means of pretreatment for the anaerobic digestion of food waste.","Fei, XH; Chen, T; Jia, WB; Shan, Q; Hei, DQ; Ling, YS; Feng, JD; Feng, HJ",Radiation technology; Food waste; Anaerobic digestion pretreatment; Soluble chemical oxygen demand,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.radphyschem.2019.108534,Chemical,oxidizer,gamma radiation,food waste,food waste,standard,12.7,12.446,46,2.4,19.1666666666667,,,
Continuous anaerobic digestion of swine manure: ADM1-based modelling and effect of addition of swine manure fibers pretreated with aqueous ammonia soaking,"Anaerobic digestion of manure fibers presents challenges due to their low biodegradability. Aqueous ammonia soaking (AAS) has been tested as a simple method to disrupt the lignocellulose and increase the methane yield of manure fibers. In the present study, mesophilic anaerobic digestion of AAS pretreated manure fibers was performed in CSTR-type digesters, fed with swine manure and/or a mixture of swine manure and MS pretreated manure fibers (at a total solids based ratio of 0.52 manure per 0.48 fibers). Two different simulations were performed. In the first place, the Anaerobic Digestion Model 1 (ADM1) was fitted to a manure-fed, CSTR-type digester and validated by simulating the performance of a second reactor digesting manure. It was shown that disintegration and hydrolysis of the solid matter of manure was such a slow process that the organic particulate matter did not significantly contribute to the methane production. In the second place, ADM1 was used to describe biogas production from the codigestion of manure and MS pretreated manure fibers. The model predictions regarding biogas production and methane content were in good agreement with the experimental data. It was shown that, MS treatment significantly increased the disintegration and hydrolysis rate of the carbohydrate compounds of the fibers. The effect of the addition of MS treated fibers on the kinetics of the conversion of other key compounds such as volatile fatty acids was negligible. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Biomethane production using fresh and thermally pretreated Chlorella vulgaris biomass: A comparison of batch and semi-continuous feeding mode,"The main challenge for an efficient anaerobic digestion using microalgal substrates is the optimization of cell wall disruption pretreatments. The objective of this work was to assess methane yield improvement using thermally pretreated Chlorella vulgaris in semicontinuous feeding operation. After thermal pretreatment, organic matter hydrolysis was confirmed by a 10-fold increase in soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD). Total COD removals ranged 36.5-49.7% for reactors fed with raw and thermally pretreated biomass, respectively. Despite the high nitrogen mineralization registered (52 and 78% for raw and thermally treated C vulgaris), no ammonium/ammonia inhibition was detected. The reactor fed with thermally pretreated biomass resulted in 50% methane yield enhancement compared with the reactor fed with raw biomass. Even though no common inhibitions were detected, methane yield values attained were comparably lower than that obtained in batch mode digestion. This study highlighted the need of further testing promising pretreatments in semicontinuous mode anaerobic digestion before claiming their effectiveness. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Lower temperature hydrothermal pretreatment improves the anaerobic digestion performance of spent cow bedding,"The anaerobic digestion (AD) performance of spent cow bedding was investigated with different hydrothermal pretreatment (HP) conditions. Spent cow bedding was pretreated with low temperatures (50, 70, and 90 degrees C) and different pretreatment times (2-72 h) with ammonia and without ammonia. The results showed that spent cow bedding was a good raw material for AD. After pretreatment, the concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in the group of hydrothermal pretreatments with ammonia (HPA) was higher than that in the HP group at the same pretreatment temperature and time. The optimal pretreatment condition was achieved with an HPA of 50 degrees C holding for 72 h. At the optimal condition, the highest concentration of VFAs was 1.58-10.85 times higher than that of the other pretreated groups. The highest hemicellulose and lignin removal rates were 58.07% and 10.32%, respectively. The highest methane yield was 163.0 ml.(g VS)(-1), which was 48.9% higher than that of the untreated group. The VFAs, pH, and reducing sugars showed positive relationships with the methane yield. Therefore, HP at low temperature can enhance the AD performance of spent cow bedding.

Techno-economic Feasibility of Extrusion as a Pretreatment Step for Biogas Production from Grass,"Grass clippings have a good biomethane potential and, if acquired from roadside verges, nature management or natural grasslands do not compete for arable land, avoiding the food versus fuel debate. However, before the grass is processed in a wet anaerobic digester, a pretreatment step is advisable to minimize the problems associated with its fibrous nature. In this study, the effects of a semi-industrial extrusion pretreatment on fresh and ensiled grass were investigated through an energetic and economic assessment. Extrusion improved the mixing properties of the grass feedstock and reduced the formation of a floating layer even at a solid concentration of 10% (w/v). This pretreatment also enhanced the biomethane potential of ensiled grass and fresh grass by, respectively, 18 and 11% on a fresh matter basis, while shredding reduced this value by 14% when compared to fresh grass. This was attributed to changes in the volatile solids (VS) content of the treated samples, as all conditions resulted in similar biomethane yields when calculated per ton of VS, ranging from 325.5 to 337.6 Nm(3) CH4/ton VS. However, ensiling resulted in a longer lag phase during biogas production attributed to the leaching of readily available sugars from the ruptured plant cells; nevertheless, this is not expected to be significant in a buffered industrial system. The revenue resulting from the extrusion treatment, between euro6 and euro17 per tonne of FM, compensated the cost of this additional step, indicating that extrusion would be a techno-economically sound process for the anaerobic digestion of grass.","Souza, MF; Devriendt, N; Willems, B; Guisson, R; Biswas, JK; Meers, E",Grass clippings; Anaerobic digestion; Extrusion pretreatment; Energy balance; Circular economy; Bioeconomy,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-021-10287-z,Physical,mechanical desintegration,extrusion,lignocellulose,grass,grass,,,,,,,,
Enhancing the hydrolysis and methane production potential of mixed food waste by an effective enzymatic pretreatment,"In this study, a fungal mash rich in hydrolytic enzymes was produced by solid state fermentation (SSF) of waste cake in a simple and efficient manner and was further applied for high-efficiency hydrolysis of mixed food wastes (FW). The enzymatic pretreatment of FW with this fungal mash resulted in 89.1 g/L glucose, 2.4 g/L free amino nitrogen, 165 g/L soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) and 64% reduction in volatile solids within 24 h. The biomethane yield and production rate from FW pretreated with the fungal mash were found to be respectively about 2.3 and 3.5-times higher than without pretreatment. After anaerobic digestion of pretreated FW, a volatile solids removal of 80.4 +/- 3.5% was achieved. The pretreatment of mixed FW with the fungal mash produced in this study is a promising option for enhancing anaerobic digestion of FW in terms of energy recovery and volume reduction.

Effect of low severity hydrothermal pretreatment on anaerobic digestion performance of corn stover,"The anaerobic digestion (AD) performance of corn stover was investigated under low hydrothermal pretreatment (HP) severity. Pretreated corn stover, with and without ammonia was examined at the three temperatures (50, 70, and 90 degrees C) coupled with different pretreatment time (24-72 h). The results showed that the pH value decreased with increasing pretreatment time for the same temperature. The highest volatile fatty acids (VFAs) concentration (4616.23 mg/L) was achieved at a HP severity of 4.56. The highest removal rate of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin were 19.62%, 25.53%, and 32.91% for HP with ammonia (HPA) severities of 3.34, 3.34, and HP severity of 4.35, respectively. The maximum methane yield of corn stover was 148.19 mL/g.VS under 50 degrees C held for 24 h (HPA severity of 2.59), which was 31.35% higher than that of the untreated corn stover.

Enhanced anaerobic digestion of food waste by thermal and ozonation pretreatment methods,"of the volume and greenhouse gas emissions from this waste type. According to EU Regulation EC1774/2002, food waste should be pasteurized/sterilized before or after anaerobic digestion. With respect to this regulation and also considering the slow kinetics of the anaerobic digestion process, thermal and chemical pretreatments of food waste prior to mesophilic anaerobic digestion were studied. A series of batch experiments to determine the biomethane potential of untreated as well as pretreated food waste was carried out. All tested conditions of both thermal and ozonation pretreatments resulted in an enhanced biomethane production. The kinetics of the anaerobic digestion process were, however, accelerated by thermal pretreatment at lower temperatures (<120 degrees C) only. The best result of 647.5 +/- 10.6 mlCH(4)/gVS, which is approximately 52% higher as compared to the specific biomethane production of untreated food waste, was obtained with thermal pretreatment at 80 degrees C for 1.5 h. On the basis of net energy calculations, the enhanced biomethane production could cover the energy requirement of the thermal pretreatment. In contrast, the enhanced biomethane production with ozonation pretreatment is insufficient to supply the required energy for the ozonator. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Enhancing Energy Recovery in Form of Biogas, from Vegetable and Fruit Wholesale Markets By-Products and Wastes, with Pretreatments","Residues and by-products from vegetables and fruit wholesale markets are suitable for recovery in the form of energy through anaerobic digestion, allowing waste recovery and introducing them into the circular economy. This suitability is due to their composition, structural characteristics, and to the biogas generation process, which is stable and without inhibition. However, it has been observed that the proportion of methane and the level of degradation of the substrate is low. It is decided to study whether the effect of pretreatments on the substrate is beneficial. Freezing, ultrafreezing and lyophilization pretreatments are studied. A characterization of the substrates has been performed, the route of action of pretreatment determined, and the digestion process studied to calculate the generation of biogas, methane, hydrogen and the proportions among these. Also, a complete analysis of the process has been performed by processing the data with mathematical and statistical methods to obtain disintegration constants and levels of degradation. It has been observed that the three pretreatments have positive effects, when increasing the solubility of the substrate, increasing porosity, and improving the accessibility of microorganisms to the substrate. Generation of gases are greatly increased, reaching a methane enrichment of 59.751%. Freezing seems to be the best pretreatment, as it increases the biodegradation level, the speed of the process and the disintegration constant by 306%.","Morales-Polo, C; Cledera-Castro, MD; Revuelta-Aramburu, M; Hueso-Kortekaas, K",waste recovery; sustainable recovery; food waste; fruit and vegetable waste; biomethane; anaerobic digestion; pretreatments,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants10071298,Physical,freezing,"freeze-thaw,ultrafreezing,lyophilization",food waste,market waste,,,,,,,,,
Evaluation of hydrogen and methane production from sugarcane bagasse hemicellulose hydrolysates by two-stage anaerobic digestion process,"This study aimed at optimizing the net energy recovery from hydrogen and methane production through anaerobic digestion of the hemicellulose hydrolysate (HH) obtained by desirable conditions (DC) of autohydrolysis pretreatment (AH) of sugarcane bagasse (SB). Anaerobic digestion was carried out in a two-stage (acidogenic-methanogenic) batch system where the acidogenic phase worked as a hydrolysis and biodetoxification step. This allowed the utilization of more severe AH pretreatment conditions, i.e. T = 178.6 degrees C and t = 55 min (DC3) and T = 182.9 degrees C and t = 40.71 min (DC4). Such severe conditions resulted in higher extraction of hemicelluloses from SB (DC1 = 68.07%, DC2 = 48.99%, DC3 = 77.40% and DC4 = 73.90%), which consequently improved the net energy balance of the proposed process. The estimated energy from the combustion of both biogases (H-2 and CH4) accumulated during the two-stage anaerobic digestion of HH generated by DC4 condition was capable of producing a net energy of 3.15 MJ.kg SBdry-1 weight.

Biogas Production from Sunflower Head and Stalk Residues: Effect of Alkaline Pretreatment,"Sunflower residues are considered a prominent renewable source for biogas production during anaerobic digestion (AD). However; the recalcitrant structure of this lignocellulosic substrate requires a pretreatment step for efficient biomass transformation and increased bioenergy output. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of alkaline pretreatment of various parts of the sunflower residues (e.g., heads and stalks) on their methane yield. Experimental data showed that pretreatment at mild conditions (55 degrees C; 24 h; 4 g NaOH 100 g(-1) total solids) caused an increase in the biochemical methane potential (BMP) of both heads and stalks of the sunflower residues as determined in batch tests. The highest methane production (268.35 +/- 0.11 mL CH4 g(-1) volatile solids) was achieved from the pretreated sunflower head residues. Thereafter; the effect of alkaline pretreatment of sunflower head residues was assessed in continuous mode; using continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs) under two operational phases. During the first phase; the CSTRs were fed with the liquid fraction produced from the pretreatment of sunflower heads. During the second phase; the CSTRs were fed with the whole slurry resulting from the pretreatment of sunflower heads (i.e., both liquid and solid fractions). In both operating phases; it was observed that the alkaline pretreatment of the sunflower head residues had a negligible (phase I) or even a negative effect on biogas production; which was contradictory to the results of the BMP tests. It seems that; during alkaline pretreatment; this part of the sunflower residues (heads) may release inhibitory compounds; which induce a negative effect on biogas production in the long term (e.g., during continuously run digesters such as CSTR) but not in the short-term (e.g., batch tests) where the effect of the inoculum may not permit the inhibition to be established.","Zhurka, M; Spyridonidis, A; Vasiliadou, IA; Stamatelatou, K",anaerobic digestion; lignocellulosic biomass; NaOH pretreatment; bioreactor experiments; biochemical methane potential; inhibition,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules25010164,Chemical,alkaline,,lignocellulose,sunflower,"head,stalks",90.5,72.6,,,,,,
Influence of Alkaline-Thermal Pretreatment on High-Solids Anaerobic Digestion of Dewatered Activated Sludge,"The influence of alkaline (23.77 mg NaOH/g total solid), thermal (134.95 degrees C), and combined alkaline-thermal pretreatment on parameters of dewatered activated sludge (DAS) during high-solids anaerobic digestion was investigated. Soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), soluble proteins, and VFAs (volatile fatty acids) concentrations were significantly higher (by two-fold) in pretreated DAS samples than in the control. During subsequent anaerobic digestion, the concentrations first increased and then decreased. Total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) decreased by 28.40% to 40.92%, and ammonia nitrogen accumulated during anaerobic digestion. For the alkaline, thermal, and alkaline-thermal pretreatments, daily methane yield significantly increased in mid-anaerobic digestion and cumulative methane yield (CMY) increased by 9.92, 35.25, and 52.95%, respectively, relative to the control. There were clear synergistic effects of alkaline-thermal pretreatment, resulting in a 17.20% increase in CMY compared with the sum of the separate alkaline and thermal pretreatments. Therefore, alkaline-thermal pretreatment was helpful for high-solids anaerobic digestion of DAS and was an effective pretreatment method. Gompertz model fitting to the CMY curve produced determination coefficients (R-2) greater than 0.9931 for all pretreatments, which was better than for a first-order kinetic model fitting curve.","Guo, HG; Du, LZ; Liang, JF; Yang, ZJ; Cui, GH; Zhang, KQ",High-solid anaerobic digestion; Dewatered activated sludge; Methane yield; Alkaline-thermal pretreatment,2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.15376/biores.12.1.195-210,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,activated sludge,dewatered activated sludge,,20,11,,,,,,
Influence of Alkaline-Thermal Pretreatment on High-Solids Anaerobic Digestion of Dewatered Activated Sludge,"The influence of alkaline (23.77 mg NaOH/g total solid), thermal (134.95 degrees C), and combined alkaline-thermal pretreatment on parameters of dewatered activated sludge (DAS) during high-solids anaerobic digestion was investigated. Soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), soluble proteins, and VFAs (volatile fatty acids) concentrations were significantly higher (by two-fold) in pretreated DAS samples than in the control. During subsequent anaerobic digestion, the concentrations first increased and then decreased. Total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) decreased by 28.40% to 40.92%, and ammonia nitrogen accumulated during anaerobic digestion.

Fungal Pretreatment by Phanerochaete chrysosporium for Enhancement of Biogas Production from Corn Stover Silage,"Corn stover silage (CSS) was pretreated by Phanerochaete chrysosporium in solid-state fermentation (SSF), to enhance methane production via subsequent anaerobic digestion (AD). Effects of washing of corn stover silage (WCSS) on the lignocellulosic biodegradability in the fungal pretreatment step and on methane production in the AD step were investigated with comparison to the CSS. It was found that P. chrysosporium had the degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin of CSS up to 19.9, 32.4, and 22.6 %, respectively. Consequently, CSS pretreated by 25 days achieved the highest methane yield of 265.1 mL/g volatile solid (VS), which was 23.0 % higher than the untreated CSS. However, the degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin in WCSS after 30 days of SSF increased to 45.9, 48.4, and 39.0 %, respectively. Surface morphology and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses also demonstrated that the WCSS improved degradation of cell wall components during SSF. Correspondingly, the pretreatment of WCSS improved methane production by 19.6 to 32.6 %, as compared with untreated CSS. Hence, washing and reducing organic acids (such as lactic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid) present in CSS has been proven to further improve biodegradability in SSF and methane production in the AD step.","Liu, S; Li, X; Wu, SB; He, J; Pang, CL; Deng, Y; Dong, RJ",Corn stover silage; Fungal pretreatment; P. chrysosporium; Anaerobic digestion; Methane; Organic acids,2014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-014-1185-7,Biological,fungi,Phanerochaete chrysosporium,lignocellulose,corn,stover,,,,,,,,
Chemically pretreating slaughterhouse solid waste to increase the efficiency of anaerobic digestion,"The combined effect of temperature and pretreatment of the substrate on the anaerobic treatment of the organic fraction of slaughterhouse solid waste was studied. The goal of the study was to evaluate the effect of pretreating the waste on the efficiency of anaerobic digestion. The effect was analyzed at two temperature ranges (the psychrophilic and the mesophilic ranges), in order to evaluate the effect of temperature on the performance of the anaerobic digestion process for this residue. The experiments were performed in 6 L batch reactors for 30 days. Two temperature ranges were studied: the psychrophilic range (at room temperature, 18 degrees C average) and the mesophilic range (at 37 degrees C). The waste was pretreated with NaOH before the anaerobic treatment. The result of pretreating with NaOH was a 194% increase in the soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) with a dose of 0.6 g NaOH per g of volatile suspended solids (VSS). In addition, the soluble chemical oxygen demand/total chemical oxygen demand ratio (sCOD/tCOD) increased from 0.31 to 0.7. For the anaerobic treatment, better results were observed in the mesophilic range, achieving 70.7%, 47% and 47.2% removal efficiencies for tCOD, total solids (TS), and volatile solids (VS), respectively.

Lignocellulosic Corn Stover Biomass Pre-Treatment by Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES) for Biomethane Production Process by Bioresource Anaerobic Digestion,"The valorization study of the largely available corn stover waste biomass after pretreatment with deep eutectic solvent (DES) for biomethane production in one-liter glass bioreactors by anaerobic digestion for 21 days was presented. Ammonium thiocyanate and urea deep eutectic solvent pretreatments under different conditions in terms of the components ratio and temperature were examined on corn stover waste biomass. The lignocellulose biomass was characterized in detail for its chemistry and morphology to determine the effect of the pretreatment on the natural biocomposite. Furthermore, the implications on biomethane production through anaerobic digestion with different loadings of corn stover biomass at 35 g/L and 50 g/L were tested. The results showed an increase of 48% for a cumulative biomethane production for a DES-pretreated biomass, using a solid-to-liquid ratio of 1:2 at 100 degrees C for 60 min, which is a strong indication that DES-pretreatment significantly enhanced biomethane production.","Olugbemide, AD; Oberlintner, A; Novak, U; Likozar, B",deep eutectic solvents; lignocellulose biomass pretreatment; biomethane production; anaerobic digestion; corn stover waste valorization,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su131910504,Chemical,solvent,deep eutectic solvent,lignocellulose,corn,stover,,,,,,,,
Enhancement of anaerobic digestibility of waste activated sludge using photo-Fenton pretreatment,"Biological treatments, such as activated sludge process, are common methods to treat municipal and industrial wastewaters. However, they produce huge amounts of waste activated sludge (WAS). The excess sludge treatment and disposal are a challenge for wastewater treatment plants due to economic, environmental, and regulatory factors. In this study, photo-Fenton pretreatment (oxidation using hydrogen peroxide and iron catalyst aided with UV light) was optimized using response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite design (CCD) to determine the effects of three operating parameters (H2O2 dosage, H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio, and irradiation time) on disintegration and dewaterability of WAS. MLVSS removal, capillary suction time (CST) reduction, sCOD, and EPS were obtained as 70%, 25%, 12,000 mg/L, and 500 mg/L, respectively, at the optimal conditions, i.e., 725 g H2O2/kg TS, H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio 80, and irradiation time 40 min. Two batch-fed completely mixed mesophilic anaerobic digesters were then operated at 15-day solid retention time (SRT) and 37 +/- 0.5 A degrees C to compare the digestibility of untreated and photo-Fenton pretreated sludge in terms of volatile solids (VS) reduction, COD removal, and biogas production at steady-state operations. Photo-Fenton pretreatment followed by anaerobic digestion of WAS was very effective and yielded 75.7% total VS reduction, 81.5% COD removal, and 0.29-0.31 m(3)/kg VSfed center dot d biogas production rate, compared to 40.7% total VS solid reduction, 54.7% COD removal, and 0.12-0.17 m(3)/kg VSfed center dot d biogas production rate for control. Thus, photo-Fenton can be a useful pretreatment step in sludge management.","Heng, GC; Isa, MH; Lim, JW; Ho, YC; Zinatizadeh, AAL",Mesophilic anaerobic digestion; Photo-Fenton pretreatment; Response surface methodology; Waste activated sludge,2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0287-5,Chemical,oxidizer,photo oxidation fenton h2o2+iron+UV,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,2.8,1.7,,,,,,
Improving methane production during the anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge: Cao-ultrasonic pretreatment and using different seed sludges,"Three individual seed sludges, which domesticated by filter paper (SS1), food waste (SS2) and grease (SS3), respectively, were used for enhancing the methane production of waste activated sludge (WAS). Also CaO-ultrasonic pretreatment was performed on WAS to evaluate the effectiveness on improving efficient anaerobic digestion (AD). The results showed that WAS being acidated for 24 h after CaO-ultrasonic pretreatment was an effective method for increasing initial methane production rate. The daily concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) during the AD course showed that the propionic was easier to be reduced after adding seed sludge. The optimum seed sludge for improving methane production and biodegradability of WAS was SS3, which led to an increase in the methane production of 68.92% and VS reduction of 69.20% higher than the control. This pretreatment combined with adding optimum seed sludge can greatly improve clean energy generation from WAS. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The selection of pretreatment options for anaerobic digestion (AD): A case study in olive oil waste production,"The aim of this work was to examine the effects of several pretreatment processes on anaerobic digestion (AD) by scoring the Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP) and the Energy Sustainability Index (ESI) of each process while taking into account the direct (heat and electricity) and indirect energy costs necessary to produce the chemicals that were used. The ESI is a measure of the ratio between the energy produced as methane during fermentation testing and that spent on pretreatment. The candidate procedures were applied to the main by-products of olive oil production: olive mill wastewaters (OMWW) and olive pomace (OP). Owing to their high organic concentration (COD > 250 g/L), high electrical conductivity, high concentration of polyphenols (0.5-5 g/L) and low pH (4-6), the biodegradation of these waste products is a difficult process with a high environmental impact. As OP and OMWW are composed of complex chemical substances such as cellulose and lignin, these products are hardly degraded pretreatment before AD becomes necessary. Based on BMP and ESI values, the most effective pretreatment was found to be the addition of CaCO3, which resulted in a biogas production of 21.6 NL/L and an ESI = 14 (i.e., the energy obtained in the form of methane is 14 times that of the energy spent).

Use of Hydrothermal Pretreatment to Enhance Biogas Production from Pelagic Sargassum,"Excessive amounts of pelagic Sargassum arriving at Mexican coastlines result in the deterioration of soil and water quality and the endangerment of endemic aquatic species, so far proper management strategies for this biomass are not being developed. Anaerobic digestion is a well-established technology for energy recovery of organic residues.

To make this conversion strategy more favourable, pretreatment is recommended. The present work compares the effectiveness of steam explosion and extrusion to increase digestibility of Sargassum. Both methods were found to improve the bioconversion of the macroalgae by nearly 80%. The solubilization of organic matter with a yield of 145 +/- 3.8 mg of chemical oxygen demand (COD) per g of dry biomass (TS) obtained by steam explosion was significantly higher than that of extrusion giving rise to 64.2 +/- 7.1 mg COD g(-1)TS.

Anaerobic co-digestion of food waste and dairy manure: Effects of food waste particle size and organic loading rate,"This study was to comprehensively evaluate the effects of food waste particle size on co-digestion of food waste and dairy manure at organic loading rates increased stepwise from 0.67 to 3 g/L/d of volatile solids (VS). Three anaerobic digesters were fed semi-continuously with equal VS amounts of food waste and dairy manure. Food waste was ground to 2.5 mm (fine), 4 mm (medium), and 8 mm (coarse) for the three digesters, respectively. Methane production rate and specific methane yield were significantly higher in the digester with fine food waste. Digestate dewaterability was improved significantly by reducing food waste particle size. Specific methane yield was highest at the organic loading rate of 2 g VS/L/d, being 0.63, 0.56, and 0.47 L CH4/g VS with fine, medium, and coarse food waste, respectively. Methane production rate was highest (1.40-1.53 L CH4/L/d) at the organic loading rate of 3 g VS/L/d. The energy used to grind food waste was minor compared with the heating value of the methane produced. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Improved methane production from waste activated sludge with low organic content by alkaline pretreatment at pH 10,"Sludge with low organic content always results in an unsatisfactory performance, even failure of anaerobic digestion. The alkaline pretreatment effect on anaerobic digestion of sludge with low organic content has seldom been studied although it gives many benefits for sludge with high organic content. In this study the influence of alkaline pretreatment (pH 10, an effective alkaline pH) on the solubilization and methane production from waste activated sludge (WAS) with low organic content was investigated. Results from biochemical methane potential (BMP) experiments showed that anaerobic biodegradability of WAS was greatly improved by alkaline pretreatment at pH 10. Methane production from the current WAS under conditions of pretreatment time 4 h and digestion time 15 d was 139.6 mL/g VS (volatile solids), much higher than that from the unpretreated WAS with digestion time of 20 d (75.2 mL/g VS). Also, the solubilization of WAS was significantly accelerated by alkaline pretreatment. Mechanism exploration indicated that the general activities of anaerobic microorganisms, specific activities of key enzymes and the amounts of methanogens were enhanced by alkaline pretreatment at pH 10, showing good agreement with methane production.","Feng, LY; Yang, LQ; Zhang, LX; Chen, HL; Chen, J",alkaline pretreatment; anaerobic digestion; key enzymes; low organic content; waste activated sludge,2013,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2013.403,Chemical,alkaline,,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Operational load enhancement for an anaerobic membrane bioreactor through ethanol fermentation pretreatment of food waste,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) of food waste (FW) tends to result in the accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFA), especially a large quantity of propionic acid that is inevitably produced. Propionic acid has a significant inhibitory effect on AD at a concentration far lower than acetic acid. Therefore, anaerobic digestion cannot be operated at an excessively high load. We proposed an AD system that used a considerable amount of starch-rich food waste for ethanol fermentation as a pretreatment and reported that it improved methane concentration in biogas with a low propionic acid accumulation even under high-load operation. This study examined whether ethanol fermentation pretreatment (EP) of food waste can contribute to high-load operation on AD using an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). This involved a sequential bath experiment using FW that was saccharized before fermentation to ethanol. The results are compared with those for FW without pretreatment. The organic loading rate (OLR) was stepwise increased to 43.5 g COD/L/d by increasing the feed OLR, the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was six days and methane content was 71%-74%, which is thrice the capability of the control series and the highest load in the reports of medium temperature AD of FW. Furthermore, the primary methanogens were tolerant to ammonia inhibition. Correspondingly, the ammonium produced improved the buffering capacity of AD at high load. Functional archaeal and bacterial communities in the two reactors were examined. The abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in AnMBR are determined to highlight the impact of the EP for FW disposal through 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Because there were multiple methanogens that use hydrogen, the higher decomposition of the substrate was attributable to the maintenance of a lower hydrogen partial pressure. It contributed to create a virtuous cycle with the EP. This study demonstrates the performance of the EP during high loading and long-term AD operation using an AnMBR; moreover, ultra-high load is achieved by changing the metabolic pathway.","Sun, J; Kosaki, Y; Kawamura, K; Watanabe, N",Anaerobic digestion; Food waste; Ethanol fermentation pretreatment; Microbial community; Anaerobic membrane bioreactor,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114840,Biological,anaerobic,ethanol fermentation,food waste,food waste,standard,20,19,,,21,,,
An integrated strategy to enhance performance of anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) is an essential process in wastewater treatment plants as it can reduce the amount of waste activated sludge (WAS) for disposal, and also enables the recovery of bioenergy (i.e. methane). Here, a new pretreatment method to enhance anaerobic digestion was achieved by treating thickened WAS (TWAS) with ferric (as FeCl3) and nitrite simultaneously for 24-hour at room temperature. Biochemical methane potential tests showed markedly improved degradability in the pretreated TWAS, with a relative increase in hydrolysis rate by 30%. A comparative experiment with the operation of two continuous-flow anaerobic digesters further demonstrated the improvement in biogas quantity and quality, digestate disposal, and phosphorus recovery in the experimental digester. The dosed FeCl3 (i.e. similar to 6 mM) decreased the pH of TWAS to similar to 5, which led to the formation of free nitrous acid (FNA, HNO2) at parts per million levels (i.e. similar to 6 mg N/L), after dosing nitrite at 250 mg NO2--N/L. This FNA treatment caused a 26% increase in methane yield and volatile solids destruction, 55% reduction in the viscosity of sludge in digester, and 24% less polymer required in further digestate dewatering. In addition, the dosed Fe(III) was reduced to Fe(II) which precipitated sulfide and phosphorus, leading to decreased hydrogen sulfide concentration in biogas, and increased percentage of vivianite in the total crystalline iron species in digested sludge. Our study experimentally demonstrated that combined dosing of FeCl3 and nitrite is a useful pretreatment strategy for improving anaerobic digestion of WAS. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

"Anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge pretreated by high pressure homogenization using expanded granular sludge blanket reactor: Feasibility, operation optimization and microbial community","Biogas production via anaerobic digestion from sewage sludge have been investigated in different reactors. However, the efficient conversion of sewage sludge into biogas via continuous operational reactor with short retention time, have been overlooked. Considering the liquid-like property of sewage sludge pretreated by high pressure homogenization (HPH), in this study, the biogas production from HPH-pretreated sewage sludge was investigated in an expanded granular sludge blanket (EGSB) reactor for 219 d. Under optimized hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 6 d, upflow velocity of 4 m/h and organic loading rate (OLR) of 1.66 kg total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD)/(m(3).d), the raw sludge was digested with a biogas production, methane content in biogas, TCOD and volatile solid (VS) removal of 215 mL/(gTCOD).d, 52 %, 43 % and 35 %, respectively. After sludge HPH pretreatment, the HRT was shortened to 5 d due to the sludge disintegration of 24 % and enhanced growth of acetolastic Methanosaeta and hydrogenotrophic Methanolinea, subsequently, the biogas production, methane content in biogas, TCOD and VS removal increased to 240 mL/(gTCOD).d, 57 %, and 58 % and 43 %, respectively. Abundance of dominant bacterial phylum Chloroflexi and archaeal genera Methanosaeta significantly increased for the improvement of organic biodegradation and methane production, respectively, reflecting the successful EGSB operation. Due to the good performances of EGSB reactor for the anaerobic digestion of HPH-pretreated sewage sludge, the combined HPH-pretreatment and EGSB reactor is promising to be applied in sustainable wastewater treatment plants.","Nabi, M; Liang, JS; Zhang, PY; Wu, Y; Fu, C; Wang, SQ; Ye, JP; Gao, DW; Shah, FA; Dai, JQ",Sewage sludge; Anaerobic digestion; EGSB reactor; Upflow; Velocity; HPH pretreatment; Microbial community,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2020.104720,Physical,pressure,high pressure homogenization,activated sludge,sewage sludge,,,,,,,,,
Bioelectrochemical system for the enhancement of methane production by anaerobic digestion of alkaline pretreated sludge,"An increasing interest is devoted to combined microbial electrolysis cell-anaerobic digestion (MEC-AD) system which could convert waste activated sludge into biogas. In this study series tests were initially conducted to study the effect of alkaline pretreatment on AD system and the results showed that alkaline pretreatment could promote the dissolution of organic matters in the sludge and thus improve the methane production. Then, the methane production in combined MEC-AD system fed with alkaline-pretreated sludge was investigated. The results indicated that the methane productions increased by 37% and 42% when applied voltage was 0.5 V and 0.8 V. The microbial electrochemical system strongly promoted the growth of Euryarchaeota (Methanosaeta and Methanobacterium ). Meanwhile, the abundance of Paraclostridium increased from 17.9% to 38.5% when applied voltage was 0.8 V, suggesting an enhanced fermentation and acetogenesis process. The results of energy balance estimation indicated that MEC-AD system at 0.5 V could achieve higher net energy output.","Xu, XJ; Wang, WQ; Chen, C; Xie, P; Liu, WZ; Zhou, X; Wang, XT; Yuan, Y; Wang, AJ; Lee, DJ; Yuan, YX; Ren, NQ",Methane production; Bioelectrochemical; Anaerobic digestion; Alkaline pretreatment; Waste activated sludge; Energy balance,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.123000,Chemical,alkaline,,activated sludge,secondary sludge,,,,,,,,,

"Co-pretreatment of wheat straw by potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide: Methane production, economics, and energy potential analysis","To improve the methane production of wheat straw (WS), the mono-pretreatment (MP) and co-pretreatment (CP) of WS with KOH and Ca(OH)(2) were conducted in this study. The results showed that the MP with KOH presented better effects than the MP with Ca(OH)(2). However, the CP with 2% KOH combined with 1% Ca(OH)(2) displayed similar effects to those of the MP with 3% KOH, obtaining the cumulative methane yield of 239.8 mL g(vs)(-1) and an improved biodegradability from 56.37% of raw WS to 66.10%. Methane production and kinetic analyses suggested that 2% KOH combined with 1% Ca(OH)(2) was the ideal condition of alkaline pretreatment for anaerobic digestion of WS. The mechanism for the improvement in methane production was clearly described by biochemical component, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses. Moreover, preliminary economics and energy potential analyses also confirmed that alkaline co-pretreatment was a reasonable method, which not only gave important guidance for future utilization of WS waste but also showed useful reference for the efficient pretreatment of other lignocellulosic wastes.","Shen, J; Zheng, Q; Zhang, RH; Chen, C; Liu, GQ",Wheat straw; Anaerobic digestion; Alkaline co-pretreatment; Improvement; Economic analysis; Energy potential,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.01.046,Chemical,alkaline,"koh,caoh",lignocellulose,wheat,straw,,,,,,,,
Comparative performance of enzymatic and combined alkaline-enzymatic pretreatments on methane production from ensiled sorghum forage,"This study investigated the effect of enzymatic and combined alkaline-enzymatic pretreatments on chemical composition and methane production from ensiled sorghum forage. Four commercial enzymatic preparations were tested and the two yielding the highest sugars release were added to evaluate any hydrolytic effect on both untreated and alkaline pretreated samples.

Improvement of methane production from rice straw with rumen fluid pretreatment: A feasibility study,"To overcome the inherent recalcitrance of rice straw during anaerobic digestion process, effective pretreatment is required for promoting methane production. In the present study, a biological pretreatment using rumen fluid was proposed. The rice straw was pretreated with the rumen fluid at 39 degrees C for 120 h under anaerobic conditions. Various volatile fatty acids, especially acetic acid and propionic acid, were produced by the rumen fluid pretreatment. The methanogenic process was carried out over a 30-day anaerobic digestion. The results indicated that the optimal pretreatment time for anaerobic digestion was 24 h, resulting in a biogas production increase of 66.5%, a methane yield increase of 82.6% and a technical digestion time decrease of 40.0%, compared with the control. At the end of anaerobic digestion, degradation efficiency of total solid and volatile solid was respectively improved by 16.4-33.3% and 14.8 31.7% for rumen fluid pretreatment. The promoted methane production and organic matter degradation could be mainly attributed to the effective hydrolysis of rice straw by the mixed microorganisms in rumen fluid. Methane production could be well explained by modified Gompertz model rather than the first order model, and a higher methane production rate of 2931 ml/(gvs.d), a rapider hydrolysis rate of 0.09 1/d, and a shorter lag phase of 1.62 d were obtained after 24 h pretreatment. Therefore, the rumen fluid pretreatment is promising for effective production of methane from rice straw and reduction of rumen fluid discharge from slaughterhouse. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

During 6-day BH at 42 degrees C (BH42), soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) increased from 175.2 +/- 38.2 mg/L to 3314.5 +/- 683.4 mg/L; the dominant volatile fatty acid (VFA) was acetic acid, and its concentration increased from 41.5 +/- 2.1 mg/L to 786.0 +/- 133.2 mg/L. The extracted extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from untreated secondary sludge contained three main fractions, and Fraction I gradually decreased from 133.9 kDa to 24.9 kDa during 6-day BH42. The BH pre-treatment at 42 degrees C and 55 degrees C both achieved more than 4-log reduction of total coliforms and 3-log reduction of E. coli. The BH pretreated secondary sludge at 15-day biochemical methane potential (BMP) test was comparable with the untreated secondary sludge after 30-day BMP, showing a significant enhancement on the acceleration of biogas production by BH pre-treatment.","Ding, HHH; Chang, S; Liu, Y",Biological hydrolysis; Anaerobic digestion; Sludge pretreatment; Biochemical methane potential; Extracellular polymeric substance,2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.08.064,Physical,thermal,biological hydrolysis,activated sludge,secondary sludge,,,,,,,,,
Biological pretreatment of non-flocculated sludge augments the biogas production in the anaerobic digestion of the pretreated waste activated sludge,"High-efficiency resource recovery from municipal solid waste (MSW) has been a focus of attention. The objective of this research is to develop a bio-pretreatment process for application prior to the anaerobic digestion of MSW to improve methane productivity. Bacillus licheniformis was used for pretreating MSW (non-flocculated with 0.07% citric acid), followed by anaerobic digestion. Laboratory-scale experiments were carried out in semi-continuous bioreactors, with a total volume of 5L and working volume of 3L. Among the nine organic loading rates (OLRs) investigated, the OLR of 0.84kgSSm(-3)reactorday(-1) was found to be the most appropriate for economic operation of the reactor. Pretreatment of MSW prior to anaerobic digestion led to 55% and 64% increase of suspended solids (SS) and volatile solids reduction, respectively, with an improvement of 57% in biogas production. The results indicate that the pretreatment of non-flocculated sludge with Bacillus licheniformis which consumes less energy compared to other pretreatment techniques could be a cost-effective and environmentally sound method for producing methane from MSW.","Merrylin, J; Kumar, SA; Kaliappan, S; Yeom, IT; Banu, JR",anaerobic digestion; methane production; municipal solid waste; biochemical methane potential; bacterial pretreatment,2013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2013.810294,Biological,bacterial,Bacillus licheniformis,ofmsw,municipal solid waste,,,,,,,,,
Enhancing methane production of excess sludge and dewatered sludge with combined low frequency CaO-ultrasonic pretreatment,"Methane production of excess sludge (ES) and dewatered sludge (DS) were investigated with low frequency CaO-ultrasonic pretreatment.

The contents of acetic acid and ethanol comprised 83.87%-92.88% of the total VFAs. The cumulative methane production (CMP) of P-ES and P-DS were 167.08 and 162.96 mL/g.VS, respectively, which resulted in 40.45% and 36.94% higher than those of untreated ones. The biodegradability of P-ES was 87.65%, which was close to theoretical value.

Improving the bioenergy production from wheat straw with alkaline pretreatment,"A pretreatment process for wheat straw using potassium hydroxide (KOH) and recycled black liquor as a treatment reagent was developed and the minimum fresh chemical and water requirement were determined. Black liquor recycling in the pretreatment process resulted in a 75% reduction in fresh water use and 25% in KOH use, when compared to no recycling. It was found that after five batches of treatment, the concentrations of reducing sugar, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and K+ in black liquor, reached stable levels. During the pretreatment with black liquor recycling, 32-35% lignin was reduced in wheat straw. The pretreated straw showed reducing sugar yield of 336-366 mg g(-1) [total solid (TS)] and methane yield of 290-303 mg g(-1) [volatile solid (VS)] when subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion, respectively.

"Effects of chemical pretreatments on material solubilization of Areca catechu L. husk: Digestion, biodegradability, and kinetic studies for biogas yield","This study aimed to understand the pretreatment-aided anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic residues and to assess the substrate solubilization capacity of pretreatment processes. We evaluated the feasibility of biogas production using chemically pretreated Areca catechu L. (Arecanut husk, AH). AH was pretreated for 24h at two different temperatures -25 ? and 90 ? with four different chemicals viz. H2SO4 (acidic), NaOH (alkaline), H2O2 (oxidative), and ethanol in 1% H2SO4 (organosolv) under each temperature. AH solubilization assessment included analyses of parameters such as volatile solids to total solids (VS:TS) ratio, soluble chemical oxygen demand, total phenolic content, and biomass composition. Alkaline pretreatment of AH at 90 ? resulted in the maximum biogas yield of 683.89mL/gVS, which was 2.3 times more than that obtained using raw AH without pretreatment. Methane content of biogas produced using AH pretreated with 2-10% of NaOH was found to be between 71.53% and 75.06%; methane content of biogas using raw AH was 62.31%. In order to describe the AH degradation patterns, biogas production potential from pretreated AH was evaluated using bacterial kinetic growth models (First-order exponential, logistic, transference, and modified Gompertz models). The modified Gompertz and logistic models (correlation coefficient > 0.99) were found to have the best fit of all kinetic models for the cumulative experimental biogas curve. We formulated a multiple linear regression equation depicting the biodegradability index (BI) as a technical tool to determine biomethane production; BI is represented as a function of biomass composition (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin), with a high correlation (> 0.95). Based on our analyses of AH pretreatment and substrate utilization for biogas production, we propose that the biochemical composition of lignocellulosic residues should be carefully considered to ensure their biodegradability when subjected to anaerobic digestion.","Vannarath, A; Thalla, AK",Lignocellulosic biomass; Arecanut husk; Alkaline pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Regression equation; Biomass composition,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115322,Chemical,alkaline,,lignocellulose,arcanut,husk,,,,,,,,
Impact of Attrition Ball-Mill on Characteristics and Biochemical Methane Potential of Food Waste,"The impact of attrition ball-mill pretreatment on food waste particle size, soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), biochemical methane potential, and microbial community during anaerobic digestion was investigated based on milling speed and time. The uniformity of particle size improved with increasing milling speed and time. The SCOD of the pretreated samples increased to 4%, 7%, and 17% at the speeds of 150, 225, and 300 rpm, respectively, compared to the control. Milling time did not significantly change the SCOD. The cumulative methane productions of 430, 440, and 490 mL/g-VS were observed at the speeds of 150, 225, and 300 rpm, respectively, while the untreated sample exhibited the cumulative methane production of 390 mL/g-VS. Extended milling time did not improve methane production much. When the milling times of 10, 20, and 30 min were applied with the milling speed fixed at 300 rpm, the methane productions of 490, 510, and 500 mL/g-VS were observed respectively. Ball-mill pretreatment also increased the total volatile fatty acids. During the anaerobic digestion (AD) of ball-mill treated food waste, acetoclastic methanogens predominated, with a relative abundance of 48-49%. Interestingly, hydrogenotrophic methanogens were 1.6 times higher in the pretreated samples than those in the control. These results showed the potential of attrition ball milling as a food waste pretreatment for improving methane production.","Gu, YM; Park, SY; Park, JY; Sang, BI; Jeon, BS; Kim, H; Lee, JH",ball-mill; pretreatment; food waste; anaerobic digestion; biochemical methane potential; microbial community,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14082085,Physical,mechanical desintegration,milling ball,food waste,food waste,standard,30,28,,,,,,
Screening of different thermal heating processes for increased methane production from lignocellulose waste material,"Pretreatment plays an important role in enhanced methane production from lignocellulose material. In this study, four different types of heating processes such as hot air oven, autoclave, liquid hot water bath, and microwave oven were used for comparison. The study was carried out in a biochemical methane potential assay to evaluate the different thermal heating process for enhanced methane production. Methane yield was increased in varied proportions with reduced digestion time for different heating processes of thermal pretreatment with low heating temperature at high residence time. Hot air oven pretreatment (17.92%) showed a high yield of methane production followed by autoclave (13.44%), microwave oven (9.54%), and hot water bath (7.54%) than control samples. In addition, the effect of pretreatment on biodegradability was assessed with three different kinetic models.

Enhanced biomethane production from corn straw by a novel anaerobic digestion strategy with mechanochemical pretreatment,"The biomethane production from lignocellulose via anaerobic digestion has always suffered from low carbon conversion rate, due to the stubborn structure of lignocellulose and the inefficiency of the current anaerobic digestion systems. The integrated two-phase anaerobic reactor can form a highly efficient anaerobic digestion system with an upper acidogenic phase and a lower methanogenic phase. However, the acidogenic phase can be overaccelerated, leading to acidification failure of the whole digestion system. In this study, the acidogenesis liquid digestate (ALD) generated from the acidogenic phase was applied to impregnate corn straw coupled with disc refining (DR) to enhance biomethane production by forming a thorough and stable integrated two-phase anaerobic system. The concentration of volatile fatty acids in the acidogenic phase is adjusted by this pretreatment technology to approximately match the efficiency of methanogenic bacteria in the methanogenic phase. The acetic acid in ALD was proved to be an effective acid to swell lignocellulose and improved the performance of the acid impregnation coupled with disc refining (AIDR) pretreatment. A 47.13% higher biomethane yield was obtained from corn straw after AIDR pretreatment. Moreover, energy conversion efficiency and economic analysis indicated this anaerobic digestion process with AIDR pretreatment had a $ 21.06 ton (-1) higher net profit than that without any pretreatment. This novel anaerobic digestion process creates a synergistic processing technology that integrates biomass pretreatment with a two-phase anaerobic digestion system, resulting in destroying the compact structure of lignocellulose, enhancing biomethane production efficiency, and improving the economic competitiveness of biomass conversion to biomethane.","Ma, SS; Wang, HL; Li, LR; Gu, XH; Zhu, WB",Biomethane; Integrated two-phase reactor; Mechanochemical pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Corn straw; Acidogenesis liquid digestate,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2021.111099,Physical,mechanical desintegration,disc refining,lignocellulose,corn,straw,92,82,42.3,0.93,45.4838709677419,,,

Exploring the functional significance of novel cellulolytic bacteria for the anaerobic digestion of rice straw,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of isolated novel bacterial strains for rice straw (RS) hydrolysis in terms of total sugar and COD (chemical oxygen demand) solubilization to improve overall biomethane yield. Four out of seven pretreatment setup with isolated bacterial strains i.e., Bacillus paralicheniformis VKVVG3 (CDf), Perlucidibaca piscinae VKVVG6 (CDct1), Bacillus clausii VKAK2 (RSa1) and Bacillus mojavensis VKAK1 (CDb1) exhibited higher saccharification compared to untreated RS. The CDf pretreated RS showed highest efficiency with 137% COD solubilization and 320% sugar accumulation at optimal dosage of 10(9) CFU/mL within 4-day of incubation. The batch reactor (20L) study with CDf pretreated RS produced 476 mL/g VSsubstrate compared to 310 mL/g VSsubstrate for untreated RS which corresponds to 53.6% higher than untreated RS. The FESEM, FTIR, and XRD analysis also support the overall results, indicating excellent degradation of the structural morphology of the RS microcrystalline structure. Furthermore, the fitting error in bio-kinetic parameters using modified Gompertz, Fitzhugh, and Monomolecular models were 5.47, 2.44, and 4.28% respectively, with R-2 values above 0.99, also supports the experimental data.

Anaerobic co-digestion of swine manure and chicken feathers: Effects of manure maturation and microbial pretreatment of feathers on methane production,"Manures and feathers are abundant wastes from the meat supply chain. Although manures are used in anaerobic digestions to produce methane, feathers recalcitrance might be challenging. Methane production was assessed during mesophilic anaerobic co-digestion (Co-AD) of swine manures with untreated/pretreated feathers. Diluted fresh (DF; 1:2) or matured (DM; 1:1) manures were used both as Co-AD inoculums and main substrates. Co-substrates were feathers (FF) and feather hydrolysates produced through microbial degradation (FH); in Controls, total solids (TS) were adjusted with sterilized manure. In DF experiments, 5.6% TS (27.7% from co-substrate) and 6.8% TS (40.4% from co-substrate) yielded similar methane production [0.48 L CH4/g volatile solids (VSinitial)]. With FF, methane production showed a two-step decomposition pattern. At 6.8% TS, FH reduced yields (43%), possibly through ammonia inhibition. In DM experiments, at 4.60% TS (12.1% from co-substrate) and 5.15% TS (21.3% from co-substrate), methane production was superior with FH (0.16-0.19 L CH4/g VSinitial); FF decreased yields (15-25%), suggesting delayed biodegradation. Modified Gompertz model fitted best to kinetic data. FF and Controls displayed similar methane yields, and FH affected production in a concentration-dependent manner. Microbial pretreatment could increase methane production by improving feathers biodegradability. FH represents a nitrogen-rich substrate for Co-AD with nitrogen-deficient biomasses.

Influence of NaOH and thermal pretreatment on dewatered activated sludge solubilisation and subsequent anaerobic digestion: Focused on high-solid state,"In this study, the influence of NaOH and thermal pretreatment of dewatered activated sludge (DAS) on the high-solid solubilisation and anaerobic digestion was separately investigated by monitoring common parameters.

Effect of ultrasonic pretreatment on anaerobic digestion and its sludge dewaterability,"To investigate the effect of ultrasonic pretreatment on anaerobic digestion and sludge dewaterability and further to probe into the influencing factors on sludge dewaterability, sludge flocs were stratified into four fractions: (1) slime; (2) loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances (LB-EPS); (3) tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS); and (4) EPS-free pellets. The results showed that ultrasonic pretreatment increased the anaerobic digestion efficiency by 7%-8%. Anaerobic digestion without ultrasonic pretreatment deteriorated the sludge dewaterability, with the capillary suction time (CST) increased from 1.42 to 47.3 (sec.L)/g-TSS. The application of ultrasonic pretreatment firstly deteriorated the sludge dewaterability (normalized CST increased to 44.4 (sec.L)/g-TSS), while subsequent anaerobic digestion offset this effect and ultimately decreased the normalized CST to 23.2 (sec.L)/g-TSS. The dewaterability of unsonicated sludge correlated with protein (p = 0.003) and polysaccharide (p = 0.004) concentrations in the slime fraction, while that of sonicated sludge correlated with protein concentrations in the slime and LB-EPS fractions (p < 0.05). Fluorescent excitation-emission matrix analysis showed that the fluorescence matters in the LB-EPS fraction significantly correlated with sludge dewaterability during anarobic digestion.","Xu, HC; He, PJ; Yu, GH; Shao, LM",anaerobic digestion; capillary suction time; extracellular polymeric substances; sludge dewaterability; ultrasonic pretreatment,2011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(10)60618-3,Physical,ultrasonic,,activated sludge,activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Solid-state anaerobic digestion of rice straw pretreated with swine manure digested effluent,"Solid-state anaerobic digestion (SSAD) is a key technology for utilization of agricultural waste due to higher volumetric methane productivity, having a high load of organics, and nearly no effluent produced. The swine manure digested effluent (SMDE) containing high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen (1000, 1500, and 2000 mg L-1, respectively) were innovatively used to pretreat rice straw replacing alkaline chemicals at 30 degrees C for 2d, 4d, 6d, 8d, and downstream processed in SSAD loaded with solid digestate of swine manure (SDSM). After pretreatment, the surface structure of rice straw was obviously destroyed, and the removal rates of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose were 1.3-20.4%, 1.3-26.3% and 13.9-28.4%, respectively. The concentrations of ammonia nitrogen in the pretreatment system were reduced by 16.75-75.47%. In the subsequent SSAD process, the accumulative methane yields in the digester loaded with pretreated rice straw increased by 93.25-261.08%, and the technical digestion time to achieve 80% of the maximum cumulative methane yield (T80) occurred 10-14 days earlier. The highest daily methane yield and accumulative methane yield of 7.37 mL/(g.VSadded.d) and 105.27 mL/(g.VSadded), respectively, were noted in the digester loaded with 2000 mg/L ammonia pretreated rice straw. Overall, SMDE pretreatment could significantly improve the biodegradability and anaerobic digestibility of rice straw, and improve the production efficiency of SSAD. The novel integrated approach to reutilization of SMDE, rice straw and SDSM not only reduced the environmental pollution, but also stimulated the sustainable development of swine farms, and promoted the carbon neutrality and economic development via effective bioenergy production as well. A large-scale trial and wide application of this approach could be expected in future.","Zheng, HM; Tang, FY; Lin, YQ; Xu, ZY; Xie, ZH; Tian, J",Rice straw; Effluent from swine manure digester; Pretreatment; Solid-state anaerobic digestion,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.131252,Biological,biological active substrate,digestate,lignocellulose,rice,straw,,,,,,,,
Towards zero waste: A valorization route of washing separation and liquid hot water consecutive pretreatment to achieve solid vinasse based biorefinery,"With increasing accumulation of solid vinasse from liquor industries of China, the valorization of solid vinasse become an urgent concern. Given its high content of rice husk (56 wt %), lactic acid (106 g/kg), and levulinic acid (50 g/kg), the roles of washing and liquid hot water pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of original solid vinasse were investigated. Washing pretreatment enhanced the methane yield of original solid vinasse by 38.09%, while the pretreatment of liquid hot water increased the methane yield of washed solid (rice husk) by 225.70%. The maximum methane yield of 214.14 L/kg TS was obtained by consecutive washing separation and liquid hot water at 170 degrees C for 2 h. Various analysis methods were conducted to explain the insight mechanism hidden in the pretreatment routes. The poor methane yield from direct liquid hot water pretreated original solid vinasse was due to formation of oligolactic acid from original lactic acid, resulted in the loss of carbon source for methane production. Furfural and phenolic oligomers contained in hydrolysate were found to inhibit methane production. A complete utilization of original solid vinasse was proposed, where the liquid fractions obtained after consecutive washing and liquid hot water pretreatment of solid vinasse were used for the mixed anaerobic digestion, while the solid fractions obtained after liquid hot water containing the crystalline cellulose and lignin covered by humins was a promising material for biochar preparation.

Improving fermentative methane production of glycerol trioleate and food waste pretreated with ozone through two-stage dark hydrogen fermentation and anaerobic digestion,"In order to alleviate substantial inhibition of anaerobic digestion by undegraded lipids that coat microorganisms in food wastes, an ozonation pretreatment was employed to degrade the lipids and promote methane production through two-stage dark hydrogen fermentation and anaerobic digestion. GC-MS analysis showed that degradation rate of glycerol trioleate into hexadecanoic acid and tetradecanoic acid increased to 78.6% when ozone concentration increased to 0.8 g-O-3/g-TVS in the pretreatment. SEM and FTIR analysis indicated that coating of methanogens by lipids during the anaerobic digestion process was substantially relieved after ozonation pretreatment. The methane yield from glycerol trioleate after dark hydrogen fermentation increased by 81.9% to 946.5 mL/g-TVS after 0.8 g-O-3/g-TVS pretreatment. When food waste (carbohydrate 45.7%, protein 21.4%, lipid 28.1%) and glycerol trioleate were mixed with a total volatile solids (TVS) ratio of 1:1, an ozonation pretreatment of 0.02 g-O-3/g-TVS gave the highest energy conversion efficiency of 78.7% through two-stage dark hydrogen fermentation and anaerobic digestion. However, excessive ozone (>= 0.05 g-O-3/g-TVS) pretreatment decreased not only hydrogen yield but also methane yield, because most small-molecular carbohydrates and a part of proteins were destroyed by ozone oxidization.","Yue, LC; Cheng, J; Hua, JJ; Dong, HQ; Zhou, JH; Li, YY",Glycerol trioleate; Food waste; Methane production; Anaerobic digestion; Hydrogen fermentation; Ozonation pretreatment,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.112225,Chemical,oxidizer,ozone,food waste,mixed,,11,8,,,,,,
Improved biogas yield from organic fraction of municipal solid waste as preliminary step for fuel cell technology and hydrogen generation,"Biogas utilization in fuel cell technology and hydrogen generation is a modern and economically viable approach.

This study was intended to find out the effects of thermal, chemical and thermochemical pre treatments on the properties and structure of OFMSW and also on biogas production. There was an increase in chemical oxygen demand of 6.87, 1.61 and 11.60% for thermal, chemical and thermochemical pretreatments, respectively. Also, the content of volatile solids was reduced by 2.36% by thermochemical pretreatment. FTIR, XRD and SEM analysis revealed that these pretreatments also caused chemical and morphological changes on the substrate, as a result reduced its crystallinity and enhanced the rate of hydrolysis. A significant increase of 54% in biogas yield was achieved after thermochemical pretreatment in comparison to untreated OFMSW sample. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

FTIR, XRD and SEM analysis revealed that these pretreatments also caused chemical and morphological changes on the substrate, as a result reduced its crystallinity and enhanced the rate of hydrolysis. A significant increase of 54% in biogas yield was achieved after thermochemical pretreatment in comparison to untreated OFMSW sample. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Solubilization of Organics Due to Thermal Hydrolysis Pretreatment and the Shift in Microbial Population in Anaerobic Digestion,"A study was conducted to analyze the effect of solubilization due to thermal hydrolysis pretreatment on the microbial population responsible for anaerobic digestion at mesophilic temperature. Metagenomic and microbial population analysis was done on digesters receiving sludge with and without thermal hydrolysis pretreatment. The digester receiving thermal hydrolysis pretreatment was stable at lower detention times and showed a shift in microbial population with predominance of methane-producing population in comparison to conventional digesters receiving no thermal hydrolysis pretreatment. Among methanogens, Methanosarcina showed dominance in the thermal hydrolysis pretreatment digester. Digesters with no thermal hydrolysis pretreatment had a mixed culture of acid-producing bacteria and methane-producing archaea, with almost equal proportion of methane-producing Methanobacterium and Methanosarcina. Kinetic parameters showed high growth and substrate utilization rates in digester receiving thermal hydrolysis pretreatment.","Berde, MS; Jolis, D",thermal hydrolysis pretreatment; Methanosarcina; Methanobacterium; mesophilic temperature; volatile fatty acids; anaerobic digestion,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.2175/106143017X15131012153194,Physical,thermal,thermal hydrolysis,activated sludge,mixed sludge,,,,,,,,,
Biological pretreatment enhances biogas production in the anaerobic digestion of pulp and paper sludge,"High efficient resource recovery from pulp and paper sludge (PPS) has been the focus of attention. The objective of this research was to develop a bio-pretreatment process prior to anaerobic digestion of PPS to improve the methane productivity. Active and inactive mushroom compost extracts (MCE) were used for pretreating PPS, followed by anaerobic digestion with monosodium glutamate waste liquor (MGWL). Laboratory-scale experiments were carried out in completely mixed bioreactors, 1-L capacity with 700 ml useful capacity. Optimal amount of active MCE for organics' solubilization in the step of pretreatment was 250 A. U./gVS(sludge). Under this condition, the PPS floc structure was well disrupted, resulting in void rate and fibre size diminishment after pretreatment. In addition, SCOD and VS removal were found to be 56% and 43.6%, respectively, after anaerobic digestion, being the peak value of VFA concentration determined as 1198 mg acetic acid L-1. The anaerobic digestion efficiency of PPS with and without pretreatment was evaluated. The highest methane yield under optimal pretreatment conditions was 0.23 m(3) CH4/kgVS(add), being 134.2% of the control. The results indicated that MCE bio-pretreatment could be a cost-effective and environmentally sound method for producing methane from PPS.","Lin, YQ; Wang, DH; Wang, LS",pulp and paper sludge; anaerobic digestion; methane production; biological pretreatment; mushroom compost,2010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0734242X09358734,Biological,fungi,mushroom compost,lignocellulose,paper,processing waste,,,,,,,,
Enhancement of methane production in anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge by thermal hydrolysis pretreatment,"This study was performed to optimize thermal hydrolysis pretreatment (THP) of sewage sludge for enhanced anaerobic digestion (AD). Using the response surface methodology (RSM), the optimal conditions were found 180 degrees C of reaction temperature and 76 min of reaction time. Through THP under optimal conditions, high molecular substances in sewage sludge such as soluble microbial by-products (SMPs) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) were hydrolyzed into low molecular ones without the generation of refractory compounds. The microbial community analysis revealed that relative abundances of Methanomicrobia such as Methanosarcina, Methanosaeta (acetoclastic methanogens), and Methanoculleus (hydrogenotrophic methanogens) in AD with THP were higher than those in conventional AD.","Choi, JM; Han, SK; Lee, CY",Thermal hydrolysis pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Sewage sludge; Response surface methodology; Microbial community,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.02.123,Physical,thermal,,activated sludge,sludge,,,,,,,,,
Mass Loss Controlled Thermal Pretreatment System to Assess the Effects of Pretreatment Temperature on Organic Matter Solubilization and Methane Yield from Food Waste,"HIGHLIGHTS Direct correlation between substrate composition and TP effect was identified. The new experimental TP set-up minimized organic compound loss during TP of FW. The solubilization of carbohydrate and protein determined the optimal temperature of FW TP. Low temperature (80 degrees C) TP attained the highest carbohydrate solubilization and methane yield. The effects of thermal pretreatment (TP) on the main characteristics of food waste (FVV) and its biochemical methane potential (BMP) and distribution of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) under mesophilic condition (35 degrees C) were investigated. The TP experiments were carried out at 80, 100, 120 degrees C for 2h and 140 C for 1 h. The designed TP set-up was able to minimize the organic matter loss during the course of the pretreatment. Soluble organic fractions evaluated in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and soluble protein increased linearly with pretreatment temperature. In contrast, the carbohydrate solubilization was more enhanced (30% higher solubilization) by the TP at lower temperature (80 degrees C). A slight increment of soluble phenols was found, particularly for temperatures exceeding 100 degrees C. Thermally pretreated FW under all conditions exhibited an improved methane yield compared to the untreated FVV, due to the increased organic matter solubilization. The highest cumulative methane yield of 442 (+/- 8.6) mUgVS(added), corresponding to a 28.1% enhancement compared to the untreated FW, was obtained with a TP at 80 degrees C. No significant variation in the VFAs trends were observed during the BMP tests under all investigated conditions.","Yeshanew, MM; Frunzo, L; Lens, PNL; Pirozzi, F; Esposito, G",anaerobic digestion; thermal pretreatment; food waste; substrate composition; solubilization; methane production potential,2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2016.00062,Physical,thermal,,food waste,food waste,standard,23,22,,,,,,
The use of thermochemical and biological pretreatments to enhance organic matter hydrolysis and solubilization from organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW),"The introduction of the anaerobic digestion for the treatment of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) is currently of special interest. The main difficulty in the treatment of this waste fraction is its biotransformation, due to the complexity of organic material. Therefore, the first step must be its pretreatment for breaking complex molecules into simple monomers, to increase solubilization of organic material and improve the efficiency of the anaerobic treatment in the second step. The hydrolysis stage is considered the rate-limiting step for the anaerobic digestion of solid wastes. Thus, in this paper thermochemical and biological pretreatments were performed to accelerate the hydrolytic processes by means of a fast organic matter solubilization of industrial OFMSW. The thermochemical pretreatments were conducted in oxidizing and inert atmospheres and sodium hydroxide was employed as an alkaline agent. On the other hand, the biological pretreatments were performed using mature compost, fungus Aspergillus awamori and activated sludge from a conventional WWTP as enzymatic agents. The results from the thermochemical pretreatment indicate that the best conditions for organic matter solubilization were 180 degrees C, 3 g NaOH/L and 3 bar. Increments of soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) of approximately 246% can be achieved in these conditions. In the case of biological pretreatments, the mature compost showed the maximum hydrolytic activity with an increase of COD of 51% for the lower inoculation percentage (2.5%, v/v).

Effect of hydrolysis pretreatment on fat degradation during anaerobic digestion of slaughterhouse wastewater,"Slaughterhouse wastewater containing pork fat particles with initial average particle sizes (D-in) ranging from 60 to 450 mum was pretreated at 25 degreesC for 5.5 h with 250 mg/l of Pancreatic Lipase 250 (PL-250). Approximately 35% of substrate neutral fat was hydrolysed during pretreatment. Enzyme pretreated and control substrates were fed to anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (ASBRs) operated at 25 degreesC. During anaerobic treatment, the first-order neutral fat hydrolysis rate averaged 0.50 +/- 0.13 and 0.63 +/- 0.07/d for pretreated and control substrates, respectively. There was no significant particle size or pretreatment effect on pork fat hydrolysis rate in the ASBR.s. Higher free long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) concentrations in the pretreated than control substrates resulted in slightly increased LCFA removal rate at the onset of anaerobic digestion with pretreated substrate. However, pretreatment had only a small overall effect on fat particle digestion at 25 degreesC, marked by a decrease of about 5% in digestion time to achieve 80% reduction in neutral fat and LCFA concentration.

Semi-Continuous Anaerobic Digestion of Orange Peel Waste: Effect of Activated Carbon Addition and Alkaline Pretreatment on the Process,"The valorization of orange peel waste (OPW) is sought worldwide mainly via anaerobic digestion. A common problem encountered during the biological treatment is the seasonality of its production and the presence of d-Limonene. The latter is a typical anti-microbial compound. This work aims to evaluate the effect of the use of granular activated carbon (GAC) combined with alkaline pretreatment to enhance methane generation during semi-continuous anaerobic digestion of OPW. The experimental design consisted of two groups of experiments, A and B. Experiment A was designed to verify the maximum OPW loading and to assess the effect of pH and nutrients on the process. Experiment B was designed to study the effect of alkaline pretreatment alone and of alkaline pretreatment aided by biochar addition to the process. Apart from the methane yields, the d-Limonene contents were measured in all experiments. The preliminary results showed that OPW alkaline pretreatment after the addition of a moderate amount of GAC can render anaerobic digestion of OPW sustainable as long as the organic loading does not exceed 2 gVS L-1 day(-1) and nutrients are supplemented. The experiment in which GAC was added after alkaline pretreatment resulted in the highest methane yield and reactor stability.","Calabro, PS; Fazzino, F; Folino, A; Paone, E; Komilis, D",alkaline pretreatment; anaerobic digestion; d-Limonene; granular activated carbon; orange peel waste,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11123386,Process improvement,disinhibition,activated carbon,food waste,orange peel,,,,,,,,,

Effect of long chain fatty acids removal as a pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion of food waste,"This study investigated the effect of long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) removal as a pretreatment prior to anaerobic digestion on the production of methane from food waste. The results showed that the anaerobic digestion of food waste containing 1.6 g COD/L of LCFAs was not inhibited (4 days lag-time, 78.3 % methane recovery in 35 days) compared to that of lipid free food waste (3 days lag time, 72.5 % methane recovery in 35 days); however, some unsaturated LCFAs, which are toxic to microorganism, were accumulated in the batch anaerobic digestion reactor. Meanwhile, in a methanogenic activity study, the activity of methanogens was observed to be linearly inhibited by the presence of more than 1 g COD/L of LCFAs. The possibility of the accumulation of unsaturated LCFAs in the reactor should be considered when operating a large-scale continuous system.","Cho, HS; Moon, HS; Lim, JY; Kim, JY",Long chain fatty acids; Food waste; Anaerobic digestion; Pretreatment; Methanogenic activity assay,2013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10163-012-0092-7,Process improvement,disinhibition,lipid extraction  long chain fatty acids removal,food waste,kitchen waste,,17,14.6,,,,,,
Methane recovery from anaerobic digestion of urea-pretreated wheat straw,"Pretreatment is necessary to improve methane production from lignocellulosic biomass. Urea was adopted to pretreat wheat straw with the advantages of structure deconstruction, its nitrogen source, and prevention of pH drop in subsequent anaerobic digestion (AD). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra measurements indicated that urea pretreatment is able to degrade the lignocellulosic structure, which was beneficial for the improvement of methane production. Urea pretreatment led to the satisfactory performance of AD with wheat straw as substrate. The maximum methane production of 305.5 L/kg volatile solids (VS) was obtained using 1% (w/w) urea loading, which was 45.2% higher than the untreatment. After 1%- and 3%-urea treatment, time used for achieving stable status (>= 50%) was 2 days earlier compared to untreatment. Reductions of total solids (49.4%), VS (54.5%), cellulose (50.4%) and hemi-celluloses (47.3%) on the optimal condition were the highest, which were 36.8%, 46.5%, 33.3% and 47.4% higher compared to untreatment. Higher levels of urea pretreatment (3% and 5%) were less efficient and resulted in the formation of pseudo-lignin according to FTIR. These results indicate that wheat straw can be used to produce methane significantly with urea pretreatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Liquid and solids separation for target resource recovery from thermal hydrolyzed sludge,"This study proposed an integrated process for biogas generation and biochar production from thermal hydrolysis pretreated sludge (THP sludge). In this study, the liquid and solids fractions of THP sludge were separately processed for the first time. The liquid fraction of THP sludge (THP-L) reached the biodegradability (262.6 +/- 5.1 mL CH4/g tCOD(feed)) on the 15th day during anaerobic treatment, while the solids fraction of THP sludge (THP-S) only contributed 31.0% to the total methane production and required more than 30 days digestion time. We investigated the feasibility to convert THP-S into biochar to realize the higher value of the solids fraction. The results prove the produced biochar can be used as slow-release fertilizer. Preliminary energy analysis was performed to evaluate the energy efficiency of the integrated approach, namely, methane generation from THP-L coupled with biochar production from THP-S. The process realized energy surplus of 0.81 MWh/tonne dry sludge. In addition, THP-L digested sludge showed better dewaterability, lower yield stress and reduced viscosity during digestion. The proposed new sludge treatment process therefore has lower operating cost and higher value returns. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Effect of Steam Explosion on the Structural Modification of Rice Straw for Enhanced Biodegradation and Biogas Production,"The goal of this study was to develop an operational steam explosion pretreatment for effective modification of rice straw chemical structure in order to improve its biodegradability and methane yield. The parameters of pressure (5 bar to 15 bar), moisture (0% to 70%), and time (1 min to 15 min) were studied in steam explosion pretreatment. The steam explosion efficiency was investigated according to the changes in crystallinity structure and chemical composition on rice straw, as well as the methane yield from straw. Steam explosion changed the structure linkages between the lignin and carbohydrate, which was indicated by a reduction in the peak intensities in the bonds from 1648 cm(-1) to 1516 cm(-1). After pretreatment, the crystallinity index of the rice straw in the 10 bar-10 min cycle with no moisture and 15 bar-10 min cycle with 70% moisture increased from 22.9% to 28.3% and 28.6%, respectively. Steam explosion efficiently decreased the lignin. The highest reduction in the amount of lignin was observed with the 10 bar-10 min cycle, which reached from 18.6% to 13.0%. The methane yield increased with the cycles 10 bar-10 min and 15 bar-15 min with 35% moisture, and 15 bar-10 min with 70% moisture by 113%, 104%, and 147% compared to that of the untreated straw, respectively. Moreover, the highest biodegradation percent of the rice straw was obtained in these cycles.","Aski, AL; Borghei, A; Zenouzi, A; Ashrafi, N; Taherzadeh, MJ",Rice straw; Steam explosion pretreatment; Lignin; Crystallinity index; Anaerobic digestion; Methane yield,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.15376/biores.14.1.464-485,Physical,thermal,steam explosion,lignocellulose,rice,straw,,,,,,,,
Evaluation of biogasification and energy consumption from food waste using short-term hydrothermal pretreatment coupled with different anaerobic digestion processes,"The effect of short-term hydrothermal pretreatment (SHP) before conducting two different anaerobic digestion (AD) processes on the enhancement of biogasification from food waste (FW) was evaluated. Results suggested that the highest biohydrogen and methane production rates were 13.33 mL/h and 15.81 mL/h, respectively, in the two-stage AD process with SHP (SHPT). The regularity of ethanol and volatile fatty acid yields indicated that the fermentation type changed from a butyric acid-type to an ethanol-type during the SHP-T. Moreover, a combination of fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectra and parallel factor analysis was used to isolate three fluorescent components. Among which, the major component was protein-like substances. According to energy flow analyses, SHPT obtained the highest net energy gains among the different AD processes. This phenomenon showed that the new SHPT technology had remarkable application potential for FW biogasification and complied with criteria relating to green energy concepts and sustainable development.

Enhanced anaerobic gas production of waste activated sludge pretreated by pulse power technique,"An electric pulse-power reactor consisting of one coaxial electrode and multiple ring electrodes was developed to solubilize waste activated sludge (WAS) prior to anaerobic digestion. By pretreatment of WAS, the soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD)/total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) ratio and exocelluar polymers (ECP) content of WAS increased 4.5 times and 6.5 times, respectively. SEM images clearly showed that pulse-power pretreatment of WAS was found to result in destruction of sludge cells. Batch-anaerobic digestion of pulse-power treated sludge showed 2.5 times higher gas production than that of untreated sludge. Solubilized sludge cells by pulse-power pretreatment would be readily utilized for anaerobic microorganisms to produce anaerobically-digested gas. Slow or lagged gas production in the initial anaerobic digestion stage of pulse-power pretreated sludge implied that the methane-forming stage of anaerobic digestion would be the rate-limiting step for anaerobic digestion of pulse-power pretreated sludge.

Continuous co-generation of biohydrogen and biomethane through two-stage anaerobic digestion of hydrothermally pretreated food waste,"Increasing accumulation of food waste (FW) exerts pressure on resource conservation and environmental protection, while conventional anaerobic digestion (AD) of raw FW for bioenergy recovery and waste minimization often encounters limitations such as fast acidification and process failure. Herein, mild hydrothermal pretreat-ment (HTP: 140 degrees C, 20 min) of raw FW was employed to advance subsequent AD performances in a long-term continuous mode. With a decreased overall hydraulic retention time (HRT) from 30 to 18 days, the two-stage system digesting HTP-treated FW maintained very stable and robust biohydrogen (38.1 mL/gVS) and bio-methane (439.6 mL/gVS) co-production, whereas both the two-stage system digesting raw FW and the one-stage system digesting HTP-treated FW exhibited deteriorating trends with significantly lower energy yields by 61.1% and 28.1%, respectively. Microbial community analyses revealed the less involvement of carbohydrate-fermenting and proteolytic microbes in the second-stage biomethane reactors as a result of the enhanced hydrolysis and acidogenesis of FW through HTP and first-stage biohydrogen fermentation. A proximate energy balance assessment indicated that the energy gain of increased biogas generation offset the extra heat require-ment for the HTP of FW, while a significant treatment capacity enhancement of 66.7% was achieved given the HRT reduction from 30 to 18 days through this integrated system.","Ding, LK; Cheng, J; Qiao, D; Li, H; Zhang, Z",Food waste; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Two-stage anaerobic digestion; Microbial community; Energy balance,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.116000,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,food waste,canteen,,7.6,6,,,,,,
Effects of mixed alkali-thermal pretreatment on anaerobic digestion performance of waste activated sludge,"In the present study, the effect of low-temperature thermal and alkali pretreatments on biodegradability of waste activated sludge was evaluated. Combined with low-temperature thermal pretreatment (80 degrees C), varied proportions of a mixed alkali (i.e., a mixture of NaOH and Ca [OH](2)) were added. The pretreatment procedures were conducted in different orders; thermal-alkali pretreatment (TAP), simultaneous thermal and alkali pretreatment (STAP), and alkali-thermal pretreatment (ATP). Following pretreatment, the sludge with the alkali-thermal pretreatment was most considerably dissolved. The SCOD concentration was up to 18,000 mg/L in the WAS, and the dissolution rate reached 112.8%. Therefore, the anaerobic digestion (AD) performance of waste activated sludge (WAS) by mixed alkali-thermal pretreatment was investigated. With an increase in sodium hydroxide content in the mixed alkali, the cumulative methane production (CMP) of the sludge increased accordingly. The maximum CMP (i.e., 430 mL/g VS [volatile solids]), increased by 308.7% compared with untreated sludge and was obtained by the pretreatment of the mixed alkali (NaOH/Ca(OH)(2) = 4:1) at 80 degrees C. The results show that low-temperature thermal treatment combined with the mixed alkali treatment can reduce the inhibitory effect of mixed alkali on AD, thereby shortening the inhibition period (6d) and increasing methane production (308.7%). The preliminary economic feasibility analysis also showed that the ATP was a cost-effective pretreatment method. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Degradation of volatile fatty acids in highly efficient anaerobic digestion,"To improve the efficiency of anaerobic digestion, we examined the effects of C-2-C-6 volatile fatty acids (VFAs) on methane fermentation, as well as the behavior of VFAs in anaerobic digestion. The VFA concentrations and methane production in anaerobic digestion were increased by pretreatment of waste activated sludge (WAS), such as ultrasonic disintegration, thermal and freezing treatments, The major intermediate products of anaerobic digestion for untreated and pretreated WAS, such as acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, butyrate, isovalerate, valerate, isocaproate and caproate, were used as substrates and the anaerobic degradation of these was carried out under the same conditions. It was found that decomposition rates of the VFAs (C-2-C-6) With a straight chain (normal form) were greater than those of their respective isomers with a branched chain (iso form). It was shown that the decomposition rates of the iso and normal forms of butyrate were greater than those of valerate and caproate. This was caused by the isomerization between butyrate and isobutyrate which occurred during the digestion process. Anaerobic bacteria in digested sludge converted butyrate to isobutyrate and vice versa by migration of the carboxyl group to the adjacent carbon atom.

"Overcoming yard waste recalcitrance through four different liquid hot water pretreatment techniques - Structural evolution, biogas production and energy balance","Liquid hot water (LHW) pretreatment is considered as a key step in reducing biomass recalcitrance and improving its accessibility to microorganisms during anaerobic digestion. In the present study, a comprehensive comparison among hot air oven, hot water bath, autoclave and microwave (MW) pretreated yard waste (YW) was conducted. The effect of treatment temperature and duration for all the four LHW pretreatment techniques were optimized with respect to the organic matter solubilisation. The results showed that all four LHW pretreatment techniques have a positive effect on organic matter solubilisation. The highest organic matter solubilisation was found in case of MW pretreatment for a treatment duration of 100 s at a temperature of 140 degrees C. Therefore, batch biochemical methane potential (BMP) of untreated and MW pre-treated YW was carried out for this treatment condition. The BMP of MW pretreated YW resulted in an improvement in methane yield to 364.5 +/- 11 mL/g VS on 26th day of anaerobic digestion, which was 1.1 times higher than that of untreated (328.9 +/- 15 mL/g VS on 45th day of anaerobic digestion). The FTIR and XRD analysis confirmed that LHW pretreatment technique removed amorphous constituents due to the polymerization of polysaccharides present in YW. In addition, SEM analysis confirmed that the LHW pretreatment led irregular and distorted structure of biomass which improved cellulose accessibility to anaerobic bacteria. A positive energy balance confirmed the possible applicability of MW pretreatment in real life projects.","Panigrahi, S; Sharma, HB; Dubey, BK",Liquid hot water; Biochemical methane potential; Anaerobic digestion; Yard waste; Microwave pretreatment,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2019.105268,Physical,thermal,liquid hot water,lignocellulose,yard waste,grass,99.5,85,,,,38,25,20

The pretreatment conditions were designed using orthogonal experiment design (OED) and central composite design (CCD) and were optimized using the direct measurement method and response surface method, the relationships among the initial digestion characteristics and TMP were subsequently analyzed, the net energy, and energy benefit were calculated. The OEM results showed that mixed DM pretreated for 30 minutes (min) and WS pretreated for 20 min (DM30WS20) produced the maximum TMP, net energy, and energy benefit of 186 mL/g TS (total solid), 6.04 kJ/g TS, and 2.88 kJ/g TS, respectively. For CCD, the maximum TMP, net energy, and energy benefit were 146.61 mL/g TS, 4.91 kJ/g TS, and 1.75 kJ/g TS, respectively, and were obtained with DM9WS25. The maximum TMP, net energy, and energy benefit of OED were greater than those of CCD, indicating that OED is more suitable for UP in anaerobic digestion (AD). When pretreated with UP, the surface of DM showed an increasingly uniform distribution and WS became increasingly rough and displayed fractures of different degrees. Cellulose activity contributed the maximum (0.3856) direct decision influence to TMP, and the comprehensive decision influence at a pH of 0.328 was the highest in TMP. This study concluded that the direct measurement, method in OED was best suited for the design and optimization of pretreatment conditions by UP in AD. UP improved TMP, net energy, and energy benefit by changing the initial environment of AD. Therefore, UP is a high-energy benefit method and worth popularizing for AD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Low-heat alkaline pretreatment of biomass for dairy anaerobic codigestion,"In this research, low-heat alkaline pretreatment was evaluated to determine the extent to which urban landscape waste (yard waste), corn stover, and switchgrass could be codigested under conditions typical of US farm-based anaerobic digestion (AD). Waste heat from combined heat and power (CHP) units associated with AD could make such pretreatment economical. Short-term batch digestion studies and 8-week continuous-feed studies were used to screen and evaluate various pretreatment conditions. Results indicate that maple and oak leaves did not digest well, even with pretreatment. Pretreatment did improve digestion of corn leaves and stalks as well as switchgrass. However, these materials also digested reasonably well even without pretreatment. No digester operational problems were observed during continuous-feed studies of intermittently stirred bench top digesters, but optimal levels of alkali, temperature, and pretreatment time may be specific to the feedstock, particle size, and digester loading rate. Results suggest that some common lignocellulosic biomass materials, such as corn stover and switchgrass, could be successfully codigested in many existing farm-based digesters. Interestingly, without pretreatment, switchgrass digestion improved over 20-fold when digested with seed culture from a dairy digester compared to seed culture from a municipal digester, suggesting that culture acclimation could be as important as pretreatment in improving digestion of specific lignocellulosic feedstocks.","Jin, G; Bierma, T",Anaerobic digestion; low-heat alkaline pretreatment; corn stover; maple leaves; oak leaves,2014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2014.929912,Chemical,alkaline,,lignocellulose,maple,leaves,,,,,,,,

Enhancement of biogas production in anaerobic co-digestion of food waste and waste activated sludge by biological co-pretreatment,"The effects of biological co-pretreatment on biogas production from anaerobic co-digestion of food waste (FW) and waste activated sludge (WAS) were investigated. FW and WAS underwent anaerobic co-pretreatment to improve hydrolysis efficiency followed by co-digestion. Results showed that the methane yield from co-digestion of co-pretreated FW and WAS was 24.6% higher than that of control substrates without pretreatment. An increase of 10.1% in solids reduction was achieved in the anaerobic digester under the optimum pretreatment time of 24 h. Compared to mono-digestion of FW with pre-treatment, the combination of anaerobk co-digestion and co-pretreatment of FW and WAS resulted in a higher treatment performance and methane production due to synergistic effects of pH amendment and enhancement of WAS particles solubilization. Pyrosequencing analysis indicated that anaerobic co-pretreatment reduced the abundance of filamentous bacteria of genus Levilinea in the subsequent co-digestion, which was liable to cause a decrease in anaerobic digestion performance.

Biomethane potential of industrial paper wastes and investigation of the methanogenic communities involved,"Background: Cellulose-containing waste products from the agricultural or industrial sector are potentially one of the largest sources of renewable energy on earth. In this study, the biomethane potential (BMP) of two types of industrial paper wastes, wood and pulp residues (WR and PR, respectively), were evaluated under both mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, and various pretreatment methods were applied in the attempt to increase the methane potential during anaerobic digestion. The methanogenic community composition was investigated with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and the ANAEROCHIP microarray, and dominant methanogens were quantitated using quantitative PCR. Results: All pretreatments investigated in this study with the exception of the alkaline pretreatment of PR were found to increase the BMP of two paper industry wastes. However, the low recalcitrance level of the PR resulted in the pretreatments being less effective in increasing BMP when compared with those for WR. These results were supported by the physico-chemical data. A combined application of ultrasound and enzymatic pretreatment was found to be the best strategy for increasing methane yields. The retention time of substrates in the reactors strongly influenced the BMP of wastes subjected to the different pretreatments. In sludges from both paper wastes subjected to the various pretreatments, mixotrophic Methanosarcina species were found to dominate the community, accompanied by a consortium of hydrogenotrophic genera. Conclusions: Pretreating industrial paper wastes could be a potentially viable option for increasing the overall degradation efficiency and decreasing reactor retention time for the digestion of complex organic matter such as lignocellulose or hemicellulose. This would help reduce the environmental burden generated from paper production. Although there were minor differences in the methanogenic communities depending on the temperature of anaerobic digestion, there was little effect of substrate and pretreatment type on the community composition. Thus, methanogen community dynamics would not seem to be an appropriate indicator regarding BMP in the AD processes investigated.","Walter, A; Silberberger, S; Juarez, MFD; Insam, H; Franke-Whittle, IH",Pulp and paper residues; Anaerobic digestion; Pretreatments; ANAEROCHIP microarray; qPCR; Methanogens; Methanosarcina,2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-016-0435-z,Physical,mechanical desintegration,high pressure extraction,lignocellulose,paper,processing waste,,,,,,,,

Alkaline-mechanical pretreatment process for enhanced anaerobic digestion of thickened waste activated sludge with a novel crushing device: Performance evaluation and economic analysis,"Although various pretreatments have been widely investigated to enhance the anaerobic digestion (AD) of waste activated sludge (WAS), economic feasibility issues have limited real-world applications. The authors examined the performance and economic analysis of an alkaline-mechanical process with a novel mechanical crushing device for thickened WAS pretreatment. The pretreatment at 40 g TS/L, pH 13, and 90 min reaction time achieved 64% of solubilization efficiency and 8.3 times higher CH4 yield than the control. In addition, a synergistic CH4 yield enhancement was observed when the pretreated and raw WAS were used together as feedstock, and the greatest synergy was observed at a volumetric mixture ratio of 50:50. Economic estimates indicate that up to 22% of WAS treatment costs would be saved by the installation of the suggested process. The experimental results clearly indicate that the alkaline-mechanical process would be highly effective and economically feasible for the AD of thickened WAS. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Optimization of liquid hot water pretreatment on Hybrid Pennisetum anaerobic digestion and its effect on energy efficiency,"To overcome the inherent complexity of lignocellulosic biomass and improve its biological conversion efficiency, the central composite surface response methodology was used to optimize the process variables (temperature, reaction time and liquid-to-solid ratio) in liquid hot water pretreatment for biomethane production from the anaerobic digestion of Hybrid Pennisetum (a typical energy crop in southern China). Temperature, reaction time and water content were varied between 160-200 degrees C, 20-60 min and 60-90 mL respectively. The biomethane yields from pretreated material were considered as response variables to different processes conditions. Results showed untreated Hybrid Pennisetum had a biomethane potential of 218.6 L/kg volatile solid (VS) (corresponding to a biodegradability of 62.6%). The effect of liquid hot water pretreatment on the biomethane yield was distinct. Pretreatment severities less than 4.55 resulted in increased biomethane yields. However, further increasing the severity led to lower biomethane yields. The optimum biomethane yield (290.6 L/kg VS) was obtained from pretreated Hybrid Pennisetum at 175 degrees C for 35 min, with the highest biodegradability of 83.2%.

Microbial effects of part-stream low-frequency ultrasonic pretreatment on sludge anaerobic digestion as revealed by high-throughput sequencing-based metagenomics and metatranscriptomics,"Background: Part-stream low-frequency ultrasound (LFUS) was one of the common practices for sludge disintegration in full-scale anaerobic digestion (AD) facilities. However, the effectiveness of part-stream LFUS treatment and its effect on AD microbiome have not been fully elucidated. Methods: Here we testified the effectiveness of part-stream LFUS pretreatment by treating only a fraction of feed sludge (23% and 33% total solid of the feed sludge) with 20 Hz LFUS for 70 s. State-of-the-art metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis was used to investigate the microbial process underpinning the enhanced AD performance by part-stream LFUS pretreatment. Results: By pretreating 33% total solid of the feed sludge, methane yield was increased by 36.5%, while the volatile solid reduction ratio remained unchanged. RNA-seq of the microbiome at stable stage showed that the continuous dosage of easy-degradable LFUS-pretreated feed sludge had gradually altered the microbial community by selecting Bacteroidales hydrolyzer with greater metabolic capability to hydrolyze cellulosic biomass without substrate attachment. Meanwhile, Thermotogales with excellent cell mobility for nutrient capturing was highly active within the community. Foremost proportion of the methanogenesis was contributed by the dominant Methanomicrobiales via carbon dioxide reduction. More interestingly, a perceivable proportion of the reverse electron flow of the community was input from Methanoculleus species other than syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria. In addition, metagenomic binning retrieved several interesting novel metagenomic-assembled genomes (MAGs): MAG-bin6 of Alistipes shahii showed exceptional transcriptional activities towards protein degradation and MAG-bin11 of Candidatus Cloacimon-etes with active cellulolytic GH74 gene detected. Conclusions: In summary, despite the unchanged sludge digestibility, the applied part-stream LFUS pretreatment strategy was robust in adjusting the microbial pathways towards more effective substrate conversion enabled by free-living hydrolyser and beta-oxidation-capable methanogens.","Xia, Y; Yang, C; Zhang, T",Metagenomics; Metatranscriptomics; RNA-seq; Low-frequency ultrasonic pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; High-throughput sequencing,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-018-1042-y,Physical,ultrasonic,,activated sludge,sludge,,,,,,,,,
Influence of hydraulic retention time on indigenous microalgae and activated sludge process,"Integration of the microalgae and activated sludge (MAAS) process in municipal wastewater treatment and biogas production from recovered MAAS was investigated by studying the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of semi-continuous photo-bioreactors. An average total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency (RE) of maximum 81.5 +/- 5.1 and 64.6 +/- 16.2% was achieved at 6 and 4 days HRT. RE of total phosphorous (TP) increased slightly at 6 days (80 +/- 12%) HRT and stabilized at 4 days (56 +/- 5%) and 2 days (55.5 +/- 5.5%) HRT due to the fluctuations in COD and NAP mass ratio of the periodic wastewater. COD and organic carbon were removed efficiently and, a rapidly settleable MAAS with a sludge volume index (SVI_10) of less than 117 mL g(-1) was observed at all HRTs. The anaerobic digestion of the untreated MAAS showed a higher biogas yield of 349 +/- 10 mL g VS-1 with 2 days HRT due to a low solids retention time (SRT). Thermal pretreatment of the MAAS (120 degrees C, 120 min) did not show any improvement with biogas production at 6 days (269 +/- 3 (untreated) and 266 +/- 16 (treated) mL gVS(-1)), 4 days (258 +/- 11(untreated) and 263 +/- 10 (treated) mL gV S-1) and 2 days (308 +/- 19 mL (treated) gVS(-1)) HRT. Hence, the biogas potential tests showed that the untreated MAAS was a feasible substrate for biogas production. Results from this proof of concept support the application of MAAS in wastewater treatment for Swedish conditions to reduce aeration, precipitation chemicals and CO2 emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using an expended granular sludge bed reactor for advanced anaerobic digestion of food waste pretreated with enzyme: The feasibility and its performance,"The high content of solid organics in food waste (FW) results in a low and unstable anaerobic digestion (AD) efficiency. Improving methane production rate and process stability is attracting much attention towards advanced AD of FW. The feasibility of advanced AD of FW pretreated with enzyme was investigated by batch experiments and 164 days running of an expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor. Simulation study based on the results of batch experiments indicates it is possible to treat enzymatically pretreated FW using an EGSB reactor. During the running of an EGSB reactor, the organic loading rate went up to 20 g chemical oxygen demand (COD)/L.d, and the total COD removal rate reached 88%. The significance of this study is to achieve an advanced AD of enzymatically pretreated FW with a stable and efficient methane production with biogas residue being reduced greatly.","Zhang, ST; Zou, LP; Wan, YL; Ye, M; Ye, JJ; Li, YY; Liu, JY",Food waste; Advanced anaerobic digestion; Suspended solid; Expanded granular sludge bed; Enzymatic pretreatment,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.123504,Biological,enzyme,,food waste,food waste ,,92,82,,,,,,
Bioelectrochemical enhancement of the anaerobic digestion of thermal-alkaline pretreated sludge in microbial electrolysis cells,"Batch experiments were conducted to study bioelectrochemical enhancement of the anaerobic digestion of thermal-alkaline-pretreated sludge in single-chamber membrane-free microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) with different applied voltage. Experimental results showed bioelectrochemical method could be combined with thermal-alkaline pretreatment to enhance anaerobic digestion of sludge.

"Electrochemical pretreatment (EPT) of waste activated sludge: Extracellular polymeric substances matrix destruction, sludge solubilisation and overall digestibility","Anaerobic digestion (AD) of waste activated sludge (WAS) is widely used for stabilisation, mass reduction and resource recovery. However, AD performance is often hampered by the poor digestibility and slow degradation rate for WAS. A series of bench-scale tests was conducted using innovative electrochemical pretreatment (EPT) method to enhance the destruction of the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) matrix and anaerobic digestibility. The results showed that the EPS matrix destruction was enhanced by 15?30% after EPT for 0.5 h at voltages of 8?15 V. The highest improvement in hydrolysis rate and overall digestibility was achieved at EPT of 15 V for 1.5 h, which was determined as 59% (from 0.27 to 0.43 d-1) and 28% (from 105 to 134 mL CH4/g VSSadded) respectively, compared with the WAS treatment without EPT. The economic analysis showed 1 h, 12 V EPT was more economically feasible.","Huang, H; Zeng, Q; Heynderickx, PM; Chen, GH; Wu, D",Electrochemical pretreatment; Sludge solubilisation; Extracellular polymeric substances destruction; Anaerobic digestion; Waste activated sludge,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.125000,Physical,electrolysis,,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,

Advanced Biomethane Production from Biologically Pretreated Giant Reed under Different Harvest Times,"Increasing energy demands and fossil fuel consumption causing global warming has motivated research to find alternative energy sources such as biofuels. Giant reed (Arundo donax L.), a lignocellulosic, perennial, rhizomatous grass has been proposed as an important bioenergy crop for advanced biofuel in the Mediterranean area. Anaerobic digestion for advanced biomethane seems to be a promising approach. However, the presence of lignin in lignocellulosic biomass represents the main obstacle to its production (due to its recalcitrance). Thus, to use effectively lignocellulosic biomass in anaerobic digestion, one or more pretreatment steps are needed to aid microorganisms access to the plant cell wall. To this end, the present study investigated the effect of fungal pretreatment of giant reeds obtained from two different harvesting time (autumn and winter) on biomethane production by anaerobic digestion using two white rot fungi (Pleurotus ostreatus and Irpex lactus, respectively). The highest biomass lignin degradation after 30 days incubation with P. ostreatus in both autumn (27.1%) and winter (31.5%) harvest time. P. ostreatus pretreatment showed promising results for anaerobic digestion of giant reed achieving a cumulative yield of 130.9 NmL g(-1) VS for the winter harvest, whereas I. lacteus showed a decrease in methane yield as compared with the untreated biomass (77.4 NmL g(-1) VS and 73.3 NmL g(-1) VS for winter and autumn harvest, respectively). I. lacteus pretreatment resulted in a loss of both holocellulose and lignin, indicating that this strain was less selective than P. ostreatus. Further studies are necessary to identify white rot fungi more suitable to lignocellulosic biomass and optimize biological pretreatment conditions to reduce its duration.","Piccitto, A; Scordia, D; Corinzia, SA; Cosentino, SL; Testa, G",Arundo donax L.; lignocellulosic biomass; anaerobic digestion; biofuel; white rot fungi; fungal pretreatment,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12030712,Biological,fungi,white rot,lignocellulose,giant reed,plant,,,,,,,,
The effect of PBS on methane production in combined MEC-AD system fed with alkaline pretreated sewage sludge,"Batch experiments were conducted to study bioelectrochemical enhancement of the anaerobic digestion (AD) of alkaline-pretreated sewage sludge in microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) in the presence or absence of phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Experimental results showed that the maximum methane production rate was increased from 0.18 mL-CH/(mLreactord) (control) to 0.2 mL-CH/(mLreactor.d) in the presence of PBS and cumulative methane production was 1.4-fold higher than that of control. The initial concentrations of SCOD, protein, polysaccharide and VFAs in the presence of PBS were slightly higher than those of control, suggesting that PBS might facilitate the release of organics into mixed liquor. The microbial community analysis results showed that the microbial community with PBS had higher diversity and Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the two most abundant phyla in the communities. Moreover, the PBS addition could enhance the growth of aceticlastic methanogens (Methanosaeta) and inhibit a portion of hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Methanobacterium), possibly due to the different cell wall composition.

Influence of Moisture Content of Solid-state NaOH Pretreatment and Codigestion on Methane Production in the Semi-dry Anaerobic Digestion of Rose Stalk,"Large quantities of burned or abandoned rose stalks are leading to serious environmental pollution. In this study, the effect of the moisture content of a solid-state NaOH pretreatment on methane production was first determined by a biochemical methane potential test. Then, the effect of codigestion with pig manure on methane production was investigated under the optimal moisture via thermophilic semi-dry anaerobic digestion by leaching bed reactor. Biogas production kinetic was assessed by the first-order kinetic model and modified Gompertz model. An increase in methane yield and biogas production kinetics was shown in the solid-state NaOH pretreated biomass. There was no significant difference in methane production for the three moisture contents studied during pretreatment (54%, 70%, and 77%). The anaerobic codigestion of rose stalk and pig manure increased 41% to 52% for methane yields and improved biogas production kinetics compared with monodigestion of rose stalk. Anaerobic codigestion did not greatly change the process stability, except for NH4+-N. The optimal process for the anaerobic digestion of rose stalk was as follows. The rose stalk was initially pretreated via solid-state NaOH pretreatment with a moisture content of 70%. Then, the pretreated rose stalk was co-digested with pig manure at a total solids ratio of 1:1.","Chen, YS; Ke, ZJ; Liang, YG",Moisture content; Solid-state NaOH pretreatment; Codigestion; Semi-dry anaerobic digestion; Kinetic assessment,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.15376/biores.14.2.4210-4223,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,lignocellulose,rose,stalk,,,,,,,,
Zero-valent iron enhanced methanogenic activity in anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge after heat and alkali pretreatment,"Heat or alkali pretreatment is the effective method to improve hydrolysis of waste sludge and then enhance anaerobic sludge digestion. However the pretreatment may inactivate the methanogens in the sludge. In the present work, zero-valent iron (ZVI) was used to enhance the methanogenic activity in anaerobic sludge digester under two methanogens-suppressing conditions, i.e. heat-pretreatment and alkali condition respectively. With the addition of ZVI, the lag time of methane production was shortened, and the methane yield increased by 91.5% compared to the control group.

Correspondingly, the methane yield increased from 1.9 to 32.2 mL, which meant that the H-2-utilizing methanogenes was enriched.

Impact of ultrasonic pretreatment under different operational conditions on the mesophilic anaerobic digestion of sunflower oil cake in batch mode,"In this study ultrasonic (US) pretreatment was investigated with the aim of improving the anaerobic digestion of sunflower oil cake (SuOC), the solid waste derived from the extraction process of sunflower oil. Five ultrasonic pretreatment assays were conducted at specific energy (SE) and sonication times in a range from 24,000 kJ/kg TS and 16.6 min (assay 1: US1) to 597,600 kJ/kg TS and 331.2 min (assay 5: US5), respectively, all operating at a constant sonication frequency (20 kHz) and ultrasonic power (120 W). As regards ultrasonic pretreatment, the working conditions of the first assay (US1) using samples of SuOC at 2% (w/v) showed to be the most appropriate in terms of both lignin and hemicellulose degradation (57.7% and 66.7%, respectively) and cellulose increase (54% increase with respect to its initial concentration). The percentage of COD solubilization increased from only 14% to 21% when SE was 25 times higher. Results obtained in batch anaerobic digestion experiments (biochemical methane potential - BMP - tests) conducted at 35 degrees C of the solid and liquid fractions released from the different ultrasonic conditions tested, indicated that for the first experiment (US1) the average ultimate methane yield obtained was 53.8% higher than that achieved for untreated SuOC.

A Combined Process for Efficient Biomethane Production from Corn Straw and Cattle Manure: Optimizing C/N Ratio of Mixed Hydrolysates,"A novel combined process, consisting of thermal-alkali pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and anaerobic digestion (AD) was utilized to methanize corn straw (CS) and cattle manure (CM) efficiently. This study aimed to identify the carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio of the mixed hydrolysates of CS and CM that maximized methane production in an AD reactor. Additionally, pretreatment conditions for CS and CM were evaluated. The optimum condition of pH 10 was 80 degrees C and 3 h of thermal-alkali pretreatment to produce 42% of hydrolysis efficiency, while a further enzymatic process increased the efficiency to 72%.

A Combined Process for Efficient Biomethane Production from Corn Straw and Cattle Manure: Optimizing C/N Ratio of Mixed Hydrolysates,"A novel combined process, consisting of thermal-alkali pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and anaerobic digestion (AD) was utilized to methanize corn straw (CS) and cattle manure (CM) efficiently. This study aimed to identify the carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio of the mixed hydrolysates of CS and CM that maximized methane production in an AD reactor. Additionally, pretreatment conditions for CS and CM were evaluated. The optimum condition of pH 10 was 80 degrees C and 3 h of thermal-alkali pretreatment to produce 42% of hydrolysis efficiency, while a further enzymatic process increased the efficiency to 72%. The C/N ratio was optimized during the co-digestion of the mixed hydrolysates, and better performances were obtained with a C/N ratio of 11 to 30 having specific methane production from 180 to 280 mL/g CODadded.

Enhanced nitrogen removal upon the addition of volatile fatty acids from activated sludge by combining calcium peroxide and low-thermal pretreatments,"This study investigated a combined low-thermal and CaO2 pretreatment to enhance the volatile fatty acid (VFA) production from waste activated sludge (WAS). The fermentative product was added to a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) as an external carbon source to enhance nitrogen removal. The results showed that the combined pretreatment improved WAS solubilization, releasing more biodegradable substrates, such as proteins and polysaccharides, from TB-EPS to LB-EPS and S-EPS. The maximum VFA production of 3529 +/- 188 mg COD/L was obtained in the combined pretreatment (0.2 g CaO2 /g VS + 70 degrees C for 60 min), which was 2.1 and 1.4-fold of that obtained from the sole low-thermal pretreatment and the control test, respectively. Consequently, when the fermentative liquid was added as an external denitrification carbon source, the effluent total nitrogen decreased to Class A of the discharge standard for pollutants in rural wastewater treatment plants in most areas of China.

Comparing Low-Temperature Hydrothermal Pretreatments through Convective Heating versus Microwave Heating for Napier Grass Digestion,"This study investigates the effects of convective hydrothermal pretreatment (CHTP) compared to microwave pretreatment (MWP) on the anaerobic digestion of hybrid Napier grass for biomethane production. For rapid estimation of methane yield (Y-CH4), enzymatic hydrolyzability (EH), whose test lasts only 2 days was used as a surrogate parameter instead of the biochemical methane potential (BMP) assay that normally takes 45-60 days. The relationship between EH and BMP was successfully modeled with satisfactory accuracy (R-2 = 0.9810). From CHTP results, quadratic regression characterised by p < 0.0001 and R-2 = 0.8364 shows that Y-CH4 increase was clearly sensitive to detention time at all CHTP temperatures. The maximal Y-CH4 achieved of 301.5 +/- 3.0 mL CH4/gVS(add) was 53.2% higher than the control. Then, MWP was employed at various power levels and microwave exposure times. Changes in lignocellulosic structure by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and energy balance demonstrate that MWP caused more damage to plant cells, which proved more effective than CHTP. In the best conditions, approximately 50% of energy was needed for MWP to achieve the equivalent improvement in Y-CH4. However, CHTP is a more suitable option since waste heat, i.e., from a biogas CHP (combined heat and power) unit, could be used, as opposed to the electricity required for MWP.","Saritpongteeraka, K; Kaewsung, J; Charnnok, B; Chaiprapat, S",hydrothermal pretreatment; microwave pretreatment; lignocellulose; Napier grass; anaerobic digestion; enzymatic hydrolyzability; energy balance,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr8101221,Physical,thermal,"hydrothermal,microwave",lignocellulose,napier grass,grass,,,,,,,,
Optimization of dilute acetic acid pretreatment of mixed fruit waste for increased methane production,"A proper waste management practice such as anaerobic digestion for the waste generated by the agro-food industries could minimize the amount of material disposal to landfill. In our study, the improvement of methane production was elucidated through the pretreatment optimization of the mixed fruit wastes (FW). Dilute acetic acid pretreatment of FW was optimized in order to increase the bioavailability and microbial accessibility. A maximum sugar recovery of 95% was achieved from the pretreated FW under the optimized conditions (0.2 M acetic acid, 62.5 degrees C, and 30 min). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Thermogravimetric (TG) analyses verified the presence of cellulosic material in the pretreated FW. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicated that the crystallinity index was increased to 56% after the disruption of complex hemicellulosic structures during pretreatment. Increased porosity and surface roughness of pretreated FW for better microbial attachment were confirmed in scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Anaerobic digestion showed increased methanogenic activity (10.17 mL g(-1) VSinitial d(-1)) in pretreated FW, during 86-day experimental period due to better microbial attachment and accessibility during the digestion process. Higher methane yield of 53.58 mL g(-1) VSinitial was observed in pretreated FW. Thus, acetic acid pretreatment is an effective method to improve the utilization and conversion of FW to methane.

Physicochemical changes of rice straw after lime pretreatment and mesophilic dry digestion,"Abetter understanding of the physicochemical properties of the material, its changes and the effects of anaerobic digestion, will help to improve methane production efficiency. The physicochemical changes of rice straw after solid-state lime pretreatment and dry digestion were investigated. Those changes were revealed by the composition of the substrate before any treatment, from samples of the material during the process and by the final product. Such compositions were studied with X-ray, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analyzes. The obtained results showed that low mass transfer limited the lignin modification and polysaccharide decomposition, resulted in a low biogas yield; and that after pretreatment and 60 days of mesophilic dry digestion, the concentration of cellulose decreased (23.4%) as well as hemicellulose (13.1%). In the opposite case, the concentration of lignin increased (59%) as well as ash (108%). The crystallinity index increased by 5.4% after pretreatment and decreased by 4.8% after digestion. The FTIR spectrogram of the raw sample included a peak reflecting absorption of ester linkages. This peak was absent from FTIR spectra of pretreated and digested samples, indicating that such linkages are broken during pretreatment and then digested by the microorganisms during the anaerobic fermentation. Furthermore, lime pretreatment and dry digestion significantly changed the decomposed profiles and rate, the distribution of pyrolysis product. The obtained data showed that polysaccharides and lignin were decomposed during pretreatment and digestion phases, leading to changes in structural and thermal properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The sludge characteristics before and after pretreatment and batch experiments of anaerobic digestion of sludge samples under different conditions were analyzed and discussed. The results showed that the mechanical pretreatment method, alone and in combination with low-temperature heat treatment, significantly improved the sludge solubility, with the highest solubility at 39.23%. The maximum biomethane yield achieved was 0.43 m(3)/kg after 10 d of anaerobic digestion of a 3% sludge sample subjected to mechanical and thermal pretreatment prior to anaerobic biodegradation. In comparison, it took more than 28 d to achieve the same biomethane production with the unpretreated sludge sample.

Enhanced performance of anaerobic digestion of cephalosporin C fermentation residues by gamma irradiation-induced pretreatment,"Antibiotic fermentation residues is a hazardous waste due to the existence of residual antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), probably leading to the induction and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in the environment, which could pose potential harm to the ecosystem and human health. It is urgent to develop an effective technology to remove the residual antibiotics and ARGs. In this study, the anaerobic digestion combined with gamma irradiation was applied for the disposal and utilization of cephalosporin C fermentation residues. The experimental results showed that the antibacterial activities of cephalosporin C against Staphylococcus aureus were significantly decreased after anaerobic digestion. The removal of tolC, a multidrug resistant gene, was improved up to 100% by the combination of gamma irradiation and anaerobic digestion compared to solely anaerobic digestion process, which may be due to the changes of microbial community structures induced by gamma irradiation.","Hu, YM; Wang, JL; Shen, YP",Antibiotic fermentation residues; Cephalosporin C; Antibiotic resistance genes; gamma irradiation pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.121335,Chemical,oxidizer,gamma radiation,other,Antibiotic fermentation residues,,8,7,47,7,6.71428571428571,,,
Anaerobic digestion and lignocellulosic compositions alteration of industrial vinegar residue after different pretreatments,"Vinegar residue (VR) is the dominated by-product associated with the industrial process of vinegar brewing. According to statistics, China' s annual output of VR is around 3.0 million tons, most of which is disposed by landfill or incineration, causing severe resource waste and environment pollution. Anaerobic digestion (AD) may be a promising approach for the stabilization of VR but the complex lignocellulosic structure in VR is a severe challenge for AD performance. To overcome this limitation, a total of 10 different pretreatments were conducted on VR. Alkaline pretreatment was more effective in enhancing the experimental methane yield (EMY) and biodegradability (B-d) in VR, especially 4% alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP) pretreatment, showing an increase of 51.7% relative to untreated. The analyses of lignocellulosic compositions alteration, Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed that better digestion performance of 4% AHP-treated VR might be attributed to its strong capacity in disrupting the recalcitrant structure of lignocellulose and removing lignin.

The aim of this research was to evaluate the utilization capacity of the SCS for methane production through a biochemical methane potential test and extent of disintegration, using dilution pretreatment. The highest methane yield, 0.227 N m(3) CH4 kg(-1) VS, was achieved at a 12.5% SCS dilution, with an organic matter removal greater than 70% and an extent of disintegration of 34.5%.

"Influence of hydrothermal pretreatment conditions, typology of anaerobic digestion system, and microbial profile in the production of volatile fatty acids from olive mill solid waste","This study aimed to investigate the production of biobased volatile fatty acids (VFAs) from pretreated olive mill solid waste (OMSW). Three hydrothermal pretreatment (HP) conditions (D1: 125 degrees C, 53 min; D2: 161 degrees C, 62 min; D3: 191 degrees C, 83 min) were selected. The pretreated olive mill solid fraction (OMSF), pretreated olive mill liquid fraction (OMLF), and pretreated OMSW were evaluated as potential substrates for acidification in the anaerobic digestion (AD) in liquid (L-AD), semi-solid (Ss-AD), and solid (S-AD) phases. The best acidification efficiency (AE) observed in this study was 65%, for L-AD and HP condition D2 (161 degrees C, 62 min). However, the HP condition D2 applied to the Ss-AD provided a VFA concentration of 18218 mg L-1, about 6-fold higher than that observed in the L-AD system. Polyphenols changed the profile of VFAs, increasing the production of longer chain VFAs in the L-AD and S-AD systems. Also, the influence of the typology of the AD system and HP severity on the microbial community was evaluated. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the most representative phyla in acidogenic fermentation of OMSW substrates and the genera Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Achromobacter, Clostridium, Ochrobactrum, and Peptoclostridium played an important role in the pretreated OMSW fermentation and, consequently, in the VFAs production profile.","da Fonseca, YA; Silva, NCS; de Camargos, AB; Silva, SD; Wandurraga, HJL; Gurgel, LVA; Baeta, BEL",Olive mill solid waste; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Volatile fatty acids; Anaerobic digestion; Microbial community,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2021.105055,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,lignocellulose,olive,mill sludge,,,,,,,,

Enhancing anaerobic digestion performance and degradation of lignocellulosic components of rice straw by combined biological and chemical pretreatment,"In order to determine eco-friendly pretreatment method, the combination of different pretreatment reagents such as: CaO, ammonia solution (AS), liquid fraction of digestate (LFD), CaO-AS and CaO-LFD were used in this study. The features of physico-chemical structures and anaerobic digestion (AD) performance of rice straw were investigated using different combined biological and chemical pretreatment methods. The results showed that CaO-LFD bio-chemical pretreatment achieved the best effect among different pretreatment conditions. The removal rate of lignocellulosic components from CaO-LFD pretreated rice straw was 20.73% higher than that of the control sample. The ether and ester bonds between lignin and hemicellulose were ruptured during pretreatment. Moreover, the methane yield from CaO-LFD pretreated rice straw was 274.65 mL gVS(-1), which was 57.56% more than the control. Compared with the untreated rice straw, T-80 decreased by 42.86%. CaO-LFD combined pretreatment has advantages as both biological and chemical pretreatment, which complement each other to improve the degradation of the rice straw. Meantime, AD performance was improved and excellent economic viability was achieved. Therefore, this study provides sustainable insight for exploring efficient pretreatment strategy to stabilize and enhance AD performance for further application. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

"Anaerobic digestion using ultrasound as pretreatment approach: Changes in waste activated sludge, anaerobic digestion performances and digestive microbial populations","To solve the problem of slow hydrolysis rate during anaerobic digestion, 20 kHz of ultrasound and energy density of 0.5 W/mL were applied as pretreatments for mesophilic anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge. The sludge was digested at hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 20 d after sonication of 0-100 min. Results showed that ultrasonic pretreatment was beneficial to the dissolution of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) from the waste activated sludge, coupled with the rapid degradation in the dewatering performance of the sludge. In the succeeding anaerobic digestion, when sonication of the treated sludge was more than 80 min, the removal rate of total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) and the sludge reduction rate also decreased significantly. Gas and methane productions were highest at the reactor fed with sludge sonicated at 80 min. At this condition, the content of CH4 was more than 53.8%, and the average yield of methane was about 36.2 mL/gVS. Through the analysis of microbial diversity, we observed that hydrolytic and acidification bacteria were abundant in the reactors. Methanocorpusculum and Methanosaeta were the alternating dominant methanogens in the anaerobic reactors, with adding sludge suffered different ultrasonic time. In the sludge pretreated with ultrasonication after 80 min, the relative abundance of Methanocorpusculum decreased rapidly, and the dominant substrate for anaerobic methanogenesis changed from hydrogen to acetic acid.

Enhancing the anaerobic digestion of lignocellulose of municipal solid waste using a microbial pretreatment method,"The use of biological pretreatment in anaerobic digestion systems has some potential; however, to date, these methods have not been able to effectively increase methane production of lignocellulose of municipal solid waste (LMSW). In this study a thermophilic microbial consortium (MC1) was used as a pretreatment method in order to enhance biogas and methane production yields. The results indicated that sCOD concentration increased significantly in the early stages of pretreatment. Ethanol, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid were the predominant volatile organic products in the MC1 hydrolysate. Biogas and methane production yields of LMSW significantly increased following MC1 pretreatment. In addition, the methane production rate of the treated LMSW was greater than that observed from the untreated sample. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Enhanced methane fermentation of municipal sewage sludge by microbial electrochemical systems integrated with anaerobic digestion,"Sewage sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant was fed into a microbial electrochemical system, combined with an anaerobic digester (MES-AD), for enhanced methane production and sludge stabilization. The effect of thermally pretreating the sewage sludge on MES-AD performance was investigated. These results were compared to those obtained from control operations, in which the sludge was not pretreated or MES integration was absent. The soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) in the raw sewage sludge after pretreatment was 31% higher than the SCOD in untreated sludge (5804.85 mg/L vs. 4441.46 mg/mL). The methane yield and proportion of methane in biogas generated by the MES-AD were higher than those of the control systems, regardless of the pretreatment process. The maximum methane yield (0.28 L CH4/g COD) and methane production (1139 mL) were obtained with the MES inoculated with pretreated sewage sludge. Methane yield and production with this system using pretreated sewage were 47% and 56% higher, respectively, than those of the control (0.19 L CH4/g COD, 730 mL). Additionally, the maximum SCOD removal (89%) and current generation were obtained with the MES inoculated with a pretreated substrate. These results suggested that sewage sludge could be efficiently stabilized with enhanced methane production by synergistic combination of MES-AD system with pretreatment process.

Effects on anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge pretreatment,"This research investigates the effect of sludge pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion of waste-activated sludge (WAS). In the key of this sludge pretreatment process, bacteria in the WAS were ruptured by mechanical jet and smashed under pressurized conditions. The protein concentrations in the sludge varied significantly after pretreatment. Protein concentration increased according to jet times and pressure. In batch experiments, volatile solids (VS) removal efficiencies were 13 similar to 50% when the WAS pretreated once under 30 bar was fed into an anaerobic digester with 2 similar to 26 day retention time. In the same operating conditions, when intact WAS was fed into the digester, VS removal efficiencies were 2 similar to 35%. Therefore, it is recognized that higher digestion efficiencies of the WAS were obtained through a mechanical pretreatment of sludge. (C) 1997 IAWQ.

"Impact of low-thermal pretreatment on physicochemical properties of saline waste activated sludge, hydrolysis of organics and methane yield in anaerobic digestion","This work studied the influence of low-thermal pretreatment (60-120 degrees C) on anaerobic digestion of saline waste activated sludge. The findings showed higher temperature and longer pretreatment time considerably improve organics hydrolysis (soluble chemical oxygen demand increased by 4.2-11.9 times) and volatile solid reduction (maximum 24.6%). Carbohydrate and proteins solubilization accelerated by 5.6-43.8 times and 8.9-35.9 times, respectively by temperature rose from 60 to 120 degrees C. Low temperature (60 degrees C) promotes faster release of ammonia and phosphate. Thermal treatment had positive effect on biogas production because methane yield was enhanced by 13.7, 27.0, 29.0 and 29.6% when pretreated at 60, 80, 100 and 120 degrees C, respectively. Significant positive relationships observed between pretreatment temperature/duration and sludge properties. Energy and economic assessment displayed anaerobic digestion of 80 degrees C pretreated sludge is more economically feasible. Thus, low-thermal pretreatment technology could be useful for improvement of methane yield in anaerobic digestion.","Biswal, BK; Huang, H; Dai, J; Chen, GH; Wu, D",Saline waste activated sludge; Anaerobic digestion; Low-temperature pretreatment; Sludge hydrolysis; Methane production,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.122423,Physical,thermal,low,activated sludge,saline waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Effect of aerobic pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of olive mill wastewater (OMWW): An ecoefficient treatment,"Anaerobic digestion experiments of olive mill wastewater (OMWW) without pretreatment were carried out and signs of inhibition in the biological process were observed after a time equal to 1.5 times the Hydraulic Residence Time (HRT) due to the presence of a high inhibitors concentration in OMWW. Based on these findings, OMWW was subjected to an aerobic pretreatment in order to reduce the concentration of phenolic compounds and decrease Total Chemical Oxygen Demand (TCOD), achieving a reduction of 78% and 90% of the initial polyphenols concentration and 18% and 21% TCOD reduction when the substrate was aerated for 5 and 7 days respectively. Finally, anaerobic digestion experiments using OMWW aerated for 5 and 7 days as substrate were conducted to determine the influence of aeration time on methane yields and TCOD reduction. The results yield 5 days as the aeration time that achieves best results, given that this stabilizes the anaerobic process, can reduce the TCOD by 65% and generates almost 0.39 m(3) methane/kg removed TCOD. Anaerobic digestion of OMWW will be economically feasible if the waste is pretreated by aerobic digestion, since the period of return of investment obtained under these conditions does not exceed 6 years.

EFFECTS OF AGITATION AND PRETREATMENT ON THE BATCH ANAEROBIC-DIGESTION OF OLIVE MILL WASTE-WATER,"The anaerobic digestion of olive mill wastewaters (OMW) can be carried out only on a diluted substrate because aromatic compounds and lipids are toxic for methanogenic bacteria. Agitation decreases methane formation in anaerobic digestion of unmodified OMW. Acidified OMW is less toxic than is raw waste. Pretreatment of OMW by fermentation with Aspergillus niger decreases the toxicity for methanogenic bacteria and facilitates anaerobic digestion.

Urine pretreatment significantly promotes methane production in anaerobic waste activated sludge digestion,"Methane production of waste activated sludge (WAS) in anaerobic digestion is hindered due to the rate-limited hydrolysis process and the low methane potential of WAS. Pretreatment of WAS is a common and appealing strategy to improve methane production in anaerobic digestion. In this study, we proposed to use urine, an easily obtained human waste with high ammonium concentration and pH, as a novel pretreatment strategy for anaerobic WAS digestion. Urine pretreatment at levels of 5-30 % (V-urine/Vurine+WAS) could substantially enhance methane production by 5-35 % in biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests, with the highest methane production of 179.6 +/- 3.3 mL/g volatile solids (VS) achieved under the highest level of urine (i.e. 30 % urine addition). Based on the model analysis, the biochemical methane potential (B-0) and hydrolysis rate of WAS (k) rose from 131.9 mL/g VS and 0.19 d(-1) in the control without pretreatment to 136.3-178.2 mL/g VS and 0.22-0.30 d(-1), respectively, after the urine pretreatment (5-30 % addition). Urine pretreatment with 5-30 % addition also improved the degradation extent (Y) of WAS by 3-35 %. The promising results indicate that urine pretreatment in anaerobic digestion is a promising technology to improve the efficiency of anaerobic digestion with environmental and economic benefits.","Liu, H; Li, X; Zhang, ZH; Nghiem, LD; Wang, QL",Urine pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Methane; Waste activated sludge; Hydrolysis rate; Biochemical methane potential,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158684,Process improvement,nutrient,urine,activated sludge,thickened waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Improving methane yield of oil palm empty fruit bunches by wet oxidation pretreatment: Mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion conditions and the associated global warming potential effects,"Palm oil production is a significant agricultural industry in the South East Asia region and the empty fruit bunch by-product OPEFB is a lignocellulosic biomass left after palm oil recovery, which has shown to be recalcitrant to bioconversion. Pretreatment experiments were carried out in this study to mitigate the recalcitrance of this material using oxygen assisted hydrothermal pretreatment (with 3-9% oxygen loading in the form of H2O2) followed by batch anaerobic digestion at both mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. The optimal pretreatment for OPEFB was found to be with 6% oxygen at mesophilic condition resulting in 43% increase in methane yield over the control while at thermophilic conditions, the ultimate methane yield was ultimately lower, but received within a shorter time period.

Pretreatment of spent coffee grounds with alkaline soju bottle-washing wastewater for enhanced biomethanation,"The production of spent coffee grounds (SCG) is steadily increasing, and its proper treatment has become an increasingly challenging task. This study explored the potential use of alkaline bottle-washing wastewater (BWW) from a soju (a Korean hard liquor) manufacturer as an alternative pretreatment agent to enhance the biodegradability and thus the biomethanation of SCG through anaerobic digestion. Thermo-alkaline pretreatment with BWW was effective in increasing the soluble organic fraction of SCG (i.e., improved bioavailability) at all temperatures tested (23-70 degrees C). The disintegration degree of the particulate organic matter in SCG ranged from 8.6 to 13.1% and increased with increasing pretreatment temperature. The 30-day methane yield (per g chemical oxygen demand (COD) of SCG fed) was significantly higher for the BWW-pretreated SCG (342.4-361.2 mL/g COD) than for the raw SCG (284.7 mL/g COD) and even for the NaOH-pretreated SCG (at the same pH as BWW, pH 12.3) tested for comparison (299.7-320.9 mL/g COD). This significant increase in methane production can be attributed to the presence of readily biodegradable ethanol derived from waste soju in BWW and the alkaline solubilization of SCG. Our results suggest a straightforward way to manage SCG and BWW together in a sustainable and economical manner.","Kim, D; Choi, H; Lee, C",Anaerobic digestion; Bottle-washing wastewater; Ethanol; Methane; Spent coffee grounds; Thermo-alkaline pretreatment,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13399-020-01171-5,Chemical,alkaline,soju bottlewashing wastewater,lignocellulose,coffea,coffee grounds,,,,,,,,
The effects of waste-activated sludge pretreatment using hydrodynamic cavitation for methane production,"Disintegration of waste-activated sludge (WAS) is regarded as a prerequisite of the anaerobic digestion (AD) process to reduce sludge volume and increase methane yield. Hydrodynamic cavitation (HC), which shares a similar underlying principle with ultrasonication but is energy-efficient, was employed as a physical means to break up WAS. Compared with ultrasonic (180-3600 kJ/kg TS) and thermal methods (72,000 kJ/kg TS), HC (60-1200 kJ/kg TS) found to consume significantly low power. A synergetic effect was observed when HC was combined with alkaline treatment in which NaOH, KOH, and Ca(OH)(2) were used as alkaline catalysts at pH ranging from 8 to 13. As expected, the production yield of CH4 gas increased proportionally as WAS disintegration proceeded. HC, when combined with alkaline pretreatment, was found to be a cost-effective substitute to conventional methods for WAS pretreatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Volatile fatty acids (VFA) constituted around 40% of the sCOD in the BH-treated sludge and 6% in the TH-treated sludge. The cumulative methane yields (NmLCH(4)/g COD fed) of sludge treated by BH55+42 and TH were respectively 23% and 20% higher than that of the untreated sludge. For BH pretreatment, sludge treated by BH55+42 produced more methane than those treated by BH42+55, BH55, and BH42.

Importance of '' weak-base '' poplar wastes to process performance and methane yield in solid-state anaerobic digestion,"Failure of methane yield is common for anaerobic digestion (AD) of '' weak-acid/acid '' wastes alone. In order to verify the importance of pH of materials on the process performance and the methane yield, the '' weak-base '' wastes-poplar wastes (PW) were used as substrate of solid-state AD (SS-AD). The results show that PW could be used for efficient methane yield after NaOH treatment, the total methane yield was 81.1 L/kg volatile solids (VS). PW also could be used for anaerobic co-digestion with high-pH cattle slurry (CM). For the group with NaOH pretreatment, time used for reaching stable state was 2 days earlier than that of the group without NaOH pretreatment. The maximal methane yield of 98.2 L/kg VS was obtained on conditions of 1:1 of PW-to-CM (P/C) ratio and NaOH pretreatment, which was 21.1% (p < 0.05) higher than that of PW. The maximal reductions of total solids (TS), VS, cellulose and hemicellulose were 51.3%, 57.5%, 46.0% and 47.0%, respectively, which were associated with the maximal methane yield.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and IR spectroscopy were used to investigate the changes in the structural characteristics of the pretreated WSD. Fungal pretreatment results revealed that A. biennis is more attractive, since it resulted in higher lignin degradation and lower holocellulose uptake. Samples of the 14th and 30th d of cultivation (i.e. the middle and the end of the pretreatment experiment) with both fungi were used for BMP tests and the effect of pretreatment duration was also evaluated. BMP increase by 31 and 43% was obtained due to the cultivation of WSD with A. biennis, for 14 and 30 d, respectively. In addition, combination of biological (after 30 d of cultivation) with alkaline (NaOH 20 g/100 gTS) pretreatment was performed, in order to assess the effect of the chemical agent on biologically pretreated WSD, in terms of lignocellulosic content and BMP. Combination of alkaline with fungal pretreatment led to high lignin degradation for both fungi, while the cellulose and hemicellulose removal efficiencies were higher for combined alkaline and L. menziesii pretreatment. The maximum BMP was observed for the combined alkaline and A. biennis pretreatment and was 12.5 and 50.1% higher than the respective alkaline and fungal pretreatment alone and 115% higher than the respective BMP of raw WSD.

Enhancement of fermentative volatile fatty acids production from waste activated sludge by combining sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate and low-thermal pretreatment,"This study investigated the combination of low-thermal and sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) as a pretreatment method to improve the volatile fatty acids (VFA) production from waste activated sludge (WAS). The results showed that the maximum VFA yield of 320 +/- 7.7 mg COD/g VS was obtained in the combined pretreatment (0.01 g SDBS/g TS + 70 degrees C for 60 min), which was 1.8, 1.7 and 4.0 times of that from sole low-thermal, sole SDBS and the control test. The mechanism study revealed the combined pretreatment had synergetic effect on enhancement of disintegration of WAS. Moreover, low-thermal exhibited greater performance on releasing organic matters, and SDBS accelerated hydrolysis and acidogenesis, thus contributing to the enhancement of VFA production in the combined pretreatment. The microbial community analysis demonstrated that the combined pretreatment increased the abundance of phyla Firmicutes which might be responsible for the improvement of VFA production.","Wan, JJ; Fang, W; Zhang, T; Wen, G",Waste activated sludge; Anaerobic digestion; Sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate; Low-thermal pretreatment; Volatile fatty acids,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.123291,Physical,thermal,,activated sludge,secondary sludge,,,,,,,,,

Effect of solid-state NaOH pretreatment on methane production from thermophilic semi-dry anaerobic digestion of rose stalk,"The effects of solid-state NaOH pretreatment on the efficiency of methane production from semi-dry anaerobic digestion of rose (Rosa rugosa) stalk were investigated at various NaOH loadings (0, 1, 2, and 4% (w/w)). Methane production, process stability and energy balance were analyzed. Results showed that solid-state NaOH pretreatment significantly improved biogas and methane yields of 30-day anaerobic digestion, with increases from 143.7 mL/g volatile solids (VS) added to 157.1 mL/g VS -192.1 mL/g VS added and from 81.8 mL/g VS added to 88.8 mL/g VS-117.7 mL/g VS added, respectively. Solid-state NaOH pretreatment resulted in anaerobic digestion with higher VS reduction and lower technical digestion time. The 4% NaOH-treated group had the highest methane yield of 117.7 mL/g VS added, which was 144% higher compared to the no NaOH-treated group, and the highest net energy recovery. Higher rate of lignocellulose breakage and higher process stability of anaerobic digestion facilitated methane production in the NaOH-pretreated groups.","Liang, YG; Cheng, BJ; Si, YB; Cao, DJ; Li, DL; Chen, JF",energy balance; methane production; rose stalk; semi-dry anaerobic digestion; solid-state NaOH pretreatment,2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2016.145,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,lignocellulose,rose,stalk,,,,,,,,
Enhancement of biogas production from sewage sludge in a wastewater treatment plant: Evaluation of pretreatment techniques and co-digestion under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions,"Boosting biomethane production makes it possible to offset the required energy in a wastewater treatment plant. In this research, using batch biomethane potential assays, various techniques including pretreatment, co-digestion, and digestion temperature rise were evaluated to increase the methane productivity of municipal sewage sludge (SS). Between thermal and sonication pretreatment methods, thermal pretreatment was shown to be more efficient and there was no need to pretreat SS for more than 0.5 h. Thermophilic digestion of SS led to 160.8% rise in the methane productivity, compared to mesophilic digestion. The most suitable co-substrate for co-digestion with SS was food waste (FW). FW and SS had little negative synergistic effect, however higher FW concentration caused to higher specific methane yield. Thermal pretreatment was not effective on FW. To evaluate the techniques, a combined cooling, heat and power plant was suggested. The energy recovery balance was positive for all the techniques, but co-digestion was not successful to reduce the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). Unlike co-digestion, thermal pretreatment and digestion temperature rise decreased the LCOE. The thermophilic digestion of SS, pretreated at 90 degrees C for 0.5 h, resulted in the lowest amount of LCOE by 43.70% reduction, compared to the mesophilic single digestion of non-treated SS.

"Effect of hydrothermal pretreatment on two-stage anaerobic digestion of food waste and Enteromorpha: Digestion performance, bioenergy efficiency, and microbial community dynamics","The effects of hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) on the performance, bioenergy efficiency, and microbial community dynamics of two-stage anaerobic digestion (AD) of food waste (FW) and Enteromorpha were analyzed. The results showed that hydrogen production and total volatile fatty acids (VFAs) concentration in the dark fermentation (DF) stage and cumulative biomethane yield in the methanogenic stage exhibited an increasing trend in response to increasing HTP temperature. The highest hydrogen and biomethane yields of 62.7 +/- 0.3 and 590.6 +/- 8.0 mL.gVS-1 were obtained at HTP temperature of 140 ?C, which were 242.6% and 11.8% higher than those in two-stage AD with untreated substrates (designated as RTCK), respectively. Simultaneously, bioenergy generation yield (BGY) of 21.18 +/- 0.44-24.21 +/- 0.32 kJ.gVS-1 in two-stage AD achieved bioenergy conversion efficiency (BCE) of 71.69-80.37% and process energy efficiency (PEE) of 22.31-39.01%, which showed 14.27-16.91% and 24.83-31.15% improvement compared to one-stage AD, respectively. HTP significantly altered the bacterial communities, resulting in the enrichment of butyric-and acetic-type fermentation bacteria and the inhibition of propionate-type fermentation bacteria. This study demonstrated that HTP could improve the performance and achieve a higher BGY in two-stage AD.","Wei, YF; Gao, J; Shi, ZG; Li, XJ; Ma, WC; Yuan, HR",Hydrothermal pretreatment; Two-stage anaerobic digestion; Enteromorpha; Food waste; Bioenergy efficiency; Microbial community structure,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2022.123639,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,codigestion,food waste+enteromorpha,,,,,,,,,
Synergistic pretreatment of waste activated sludge using CaO2 in combination with microwave irradiation to enhance methane production during anaerobic digestion,"To investigate the effects of combined calcium peroxide (CaO2) and microwave pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge, lab-scale experiments were conducted to measure the solubilization, biodegradation, and dewaterability of the waste activated sludge. Additionally, the synergistic effects between CaO2 and microwave were studied, and the microbial activity and methanogenic archaea community structure were analyzed. Combined pretreatment considerably facilitated the solubilization and subsequent anaerobic digestion of the waste activated sludge. The optimal pretreatment condition was CaO2 (0.1 g/gVSS)/microwave (480 W, 2 min) for methane production during the subsequent anaerobic digestion process. Under this condition, 80.2% higher CH4 accumulation yield was achieved after 16 d of anaerobic digestion when compared with the control. The synergistic effects of CaO2/microwave pretreatment resulted from the different mechanisms of CaO2 and microwave treatments. Further, microwave irradiation increased.0H generation from CaO2 and significantly alleviated the inhibitory effect of CaO2 on methanogens. The activities of hydrolytic enzymes and acid-forming enzymes in the waste activated sludge were improved after CaO2 (0.1 g/gVSS)/microwave (480 W, 2 min) pretreatment. Methanogenesis enzyme activity was also higher after CaO2 treatment (0.1 g/gVSS)/microwave (480 W, 2 min) following a lag period. Illumina MiSeq sequencing analysis indicated that acetate-utilizing methanogen (Methanosaeta sp.) and H-2/CO2-utilizing methanogen (Methanospirillum sp.) abundance improved greatly following CaO2 (0.1 g/gVSS)/microwave (480 W, 2 min) pretreatment. The percentage of CH4 in biogas with CaO2/microwave pretreatment increased by 25.4% relative to the control. The dewaterability of the waste activated sludge also improved considerably after anaerobic digestion with combined CaO2/microwave treatment.

Effect of low temperature of thermal pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of textile dyeing sludge,"The minimization and methane production of textile dyeing sludge (TDS) can be simultaneously attained via anaerobic digestion (AD). However, the possible toxicity and complex recalcitrant organic matters involved in limited the hydrolysis of TDS. Therefore, the low-temperature of thermal pretreatment (LTTP) lasting for 1 h at temperatures from 60 to 100 degrees C was employed to accelerate the hydrolysis and subsequent methane generation of TDS. The results showed that LTTP with temperatures higher than 70 degrees C obviously improve the AD performance of TDS. Highest accumulative methane production was achieved for 100 degrees C pretreated TDS and from thermal analysis point of view it was due to the disintegration of some recalcitrant macromolecules in TDS.

Optimization of biogas production from coffee production waste,"This study was conducted to investigate the effects of chemical pretreatments on biogas production from coffee waste. After the preparation of a mixture of coffee waste with a TS concentration of 10% w/w, basic and acid pretreatments were conducted in batch mode and their performances were compared with the biogas produced from a mixture without any pretreatment stage. The basic pretreatment demonstrated a very good action on the hydrolysis of the lignin and cellulose, and permitted a biogas production of about 18 NL/L with a methane content of almost 80% v/v. Thus, the basic pretreatment has been used to scale-up the process. The coffee refuse was has been carried out in a 45 L anaerobic reactor working in continuous mode and in a mesophilic condition (35 degrees C) with a Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) of about 40 days. A high biogas production of 1.14 NL/L d, with a methane percentage of 65% v/v was obtained, thus permitting a process yield of about 83% to be obtained. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Enhanced simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of Napier grass and Napier silage for two stage bio-hydrogen and methane production using organosolv and hydrothermal,"This study aims to enhance the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of Napier grass and silage for two-stage bio-hydrogen and methane production using organosolv and hydrothermal pretreatments. The organosolv pretreatment of Napier grass and silage, catalyzed by sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid, substantially increased hydrogen yields 1.34 and 1.55 times compared with those of untreated Napier grass and silage, respectively. In the second-stage fermentation, the hydrogenic effluents from each treatment were further converted to methane. A maximum methane yield of 278.2 +/- 3.2 and 263.4 +/- 6.2 mL/g-substrateadded was obtained from the effluents of the auto-catalyzed (without catalysts) organosolv-pretreated Napier grass and silage, respectively. Consequently, a maximum total energy yield of 11.0 kJ/g-substrateadded and 10.4 kJ/g-substrateadded was gained from the auto-catalyzed Napier grass and silage, respectively.

Improving biogas production from different parts of spruce tree using leading pretreatments,"Spruce is the most resistant type of lignocellulosic material to anaerobic digestion. Different parts of spruce tree, i.e., leaves, wood, branches, bark, fruit, and mixtures of these parts, were pretreated using the leading pre -treatments, i.e., concentrated phosphoric acid, dilute sulfuric acid, and ethanolic organosolv pretreatment, to improve biogas production. The pretreatment effects on methane yield from both solid and liquid fractions of the pretreatments were evaluated. Different parts of the tree showed different behaviors. The maximum methane yields from the pretreated solids were obtained after phosphoric acid pretreatment, which yielded methane yields of 211.7 and 225.5 mL per g volatile solids (VS) of pretreated spruce leaves and mixture, respectively. The improvements were related to opened-up structure, crystallinity reduction, and delignification. Sulfuric acid pretreatment improved biomethane yield from liquids, but not solids. Moreover, organosolv pretreatment improved the yield from solids, but not wood, bark, and the mixture. The maximum methane production yield was 245.3 NmL CH4/gVS which was obtained from the organosolv liquor of spruce leaves. The highest overall methane production (252.9 L per Kg) was gained from the whole solid and liquid fractions from organosolv pretreatment of leaves. This methane yield corresponded to 2.4-fold improvement compared to that of the un-treated leaves (107 NmL CH4/gVS).

Ultrasonic pretreatment for anaerobic digestion of suspended and attached growth sludges,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a proven technology for energy production from the stabilization and reduction of sewage waste. The AD and impact of ultrasonic pretreatment of four waste activated sludges (WASs) from conventional and three non-conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants were investigated. WAS from a conventional activated sludge (CAS) system, a rotating biological contactor (RBC), a lagoon, and a nitrifying moving-bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) were pretreated with ultrasonic energies of 800-6,550 kJ/kg total solids to illustrate the impact of sludge type and ultrasonic pretreatment on biogas production (BGP), solubilization, and digestion kinetics. The greatest increase in BGP over the control of pretreated sludge did not coincide consistently with greater sonication energy but occurred within a solubilization range of 2.9-7.4% degree of disintegration and are as follows: 5% +/- 3 biogas increase for CAS, 12% +/- 9 for lagoon, 15% +/- 2 for nitrifying MBBR, and 20% +/- 2 for RBC. The effect of sonication on digestion kinetics was inconclusive with the application of modified Gompertz, reaction curve, and first-order models to biogas production. These results illustrate the unique response of differing sludges to the same levels of sonication energies.","Roebuck, P; Kennedy, K; Delatolla, R",anaerobic digestion; degree of disintegration; municipal sewage sludge; pretreatment; sonication; ultrasound; waste activated sludge,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wqrj.2019.039,Physical,ultrasonic,,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Biohythane production from Chlorella sp biomass by two-stage thermophilic solid-state anaerobic digestion,"Two-stage thermophilic solid state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD) processes for biohythane production from Chlorella sp. biomass was investigated. The hydrogen and methane yield from fresh Chlorella sp. biomass was 124.9 mL H-2 gVS(-1) and 230.1 mL CH4 gVS(-1), respectively, at 16% TS with biodegradation efficiency of 34%. Hydrogen and methane production from hydrothermal pretreated Chlorella sp. biomass was 190.0 mL H-2 gVS(-1) and 319.8 mL CH4 gVS(-)1, respectively at 16% TS with biodegradation efficiency of 47%. Pretreatment of Chlorella sp. biomass with hydrothermal follow by two-stage thermophilic SS-AD improved 150% biogas production comparing with fresh biomass. Clostridium sp. was the main bacteria responsible for hydrogen production. Clostridium sp. and Ruminococcus sp. was main bacteria in methane stage, while Methanoculleus sp. and Methanothermobacter sp. was dominated archaea in methane production process.

Combined pretreatment using CaO and liquid fraction of digestate of rice straw: Anaerobic digestion performance and electron transfer,"To improve anaerobic digestion (AD) efficiency of rice straw, solid alkaline CaO and the liquid fraction of digestate (LFD) were used as pretreatment agents of rice straw. The results showed that AD performance of rice straw with CaO - LFD pretreatment was optimal in different pretreatment methods of the CaO + LFD, CaO - LFD, LFD + CaO, CaO, and LFD. The maximum methane yield (314 ml.(g VS)(-1)) and the highest VFAs concentration (14851 mg.L-1 on day 3) of the CaO - LFD pretreatment group were 81% and 118% higher than that of the control group, respectively.

Effect of gentamicin mycelial residues disintegration by microwave-alkaline pretreatment on methane production and gentamicin degradation during anaerobic digestion,"Gentamicin mycelial residues (GMRs) are microbial fermentation residues of the pharmaceutical industry. In this study, anaerobic digestion of GMRs in combination with microwave-alkaline pretreatment (MAPT) was first employed to enhance methane production and the efficiency of gentamicin degradation. The anaerobic digestion batch tests were conducted to optimize the MAPT conditions, and semi-continuous tests of three-month duration were carried out to investigate the anaerobic digestion performance and fate of gentamicin. The results indicated that the GMRs flocs were substantially disintegrated after MAPT, and the average particle size was significantly related to methane production (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the solubilization of proteins after MAPT demonstrated a prominently positive effect on the anaerobic digestion performance of GMRs (p 0.05), including biochemical methane potential, lag phase and maximum methane production rate fitted by modified Gompertz model. The results of the batch tests of MAPT pretreated GMRs (pH 12) suggested that the excessive alkali dosage in the pretreatment process adversely affected the anaerobic digestion performance due to the solubilization or generation of the refractory compounds (e.g. melanoidin). An increase of 58.05% in methane production (323.33 ? 11.88 mL gVS-1) was accomplished by MAPT in the sable running stage of the semi-continuous stirring tank reactor. The analysis of gentamicin mass balance in anaerobic digestion process demonstrated that the degradation was a preponderant mechanism for gentamicin removal. Simultaneously, MAPT facilitated the release of gentamicin trapped in flocs, thus, effectively improving the average degradation efficiency of gentamicin in anaerobic digestion process (degradation efficiency: 97.70 ? 0.63%).","Jiang, MY; Song, SQ; Liu, HL; Wang, P; Dai, XH",Gentamicin mycelial residues; Microwave alkaline pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Modified Gompertz model; Gentamicin mass balance,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2021.128790,Physical,thermal,microwave,other,mycelial residues,,,,,,,,,

INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT AEROBIC PRETREATMENTS ON THE KINETICS OF ANAEROBIC-DIGESTION OF OLIVE MILL WASTE-WATER,"A kinetic study was carried out on the anaerobic digestion of Olive Mill Wastewater (OMW) and OMW that was previously fermented with Geolrichum candidum, Azotobacter chrooeoccum and Aspergillus terreus. The bioreactor used was batch fed and contained sepiolite as support for the mediating bacteria. Experimental data observed for methane production (G) against time (t) are described by the following equation: G = G(M)[1 - exp(- AXt/S-0), over the COD range studied (3.9-14.5 g/l), where G(M) is the maximum methane volume obtained at the end of digestion time; S-0 is the initial substrate concentration; X is the microorganism concentration and A is the kinetic constant of the process, which was calculated using a nonlinear regression; This kinetic parameter was found to be influenced by the pretreatment carried out, and was 4.6, 4.1 and 2.3 times higher for Aspergillus, Azotobacter and Geotrichum-pretreated OMW's than that obtained in the anaerobic digestion of untreated OMW. The kinetic constant increased when the phenolic compound content and biotoxicity of the pretreated-OMW's decreased. Finally, the yield coefficient, T-p, was 260 (untreated OMW), 300 (Geotrichum-pretreated OMW), 315 (Azotobacter-pretreated OMW) and 350 (Aspergillus-pretreated OMW) ml CH4 STP/g COD.","BORJA, R; MARTIN, A; ALONSO, V; GARCIA, I; BANKS, CJ",AEROBIC PRETREATMENT; ANAEROBIC DIGESTION; ASPERGILLUS TERREUS; AZOTOBACTER CHROOCOCCUM; BIOTOXICITY; GEOTRICHUM CANDIDUM; KINETICS; PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS,1995,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(94)00180-F,Biological,aerobic,"Geolrichum candidum, Azotobacter chrooeoccum and Aspergillus terreus",food industry organic waste,olive mill wastewater,mill wastewater,49,41.9,,,,,,
Effect of mild-temperature H O-2 (2) oxidation on solubilization and anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge,"Efficient sludge management is among the most challenging issues in wastewater treatment today, and anaerobic digestion is regarded as a viable solution. Mild-temperature H O-2 (2) oxidation was examined for enhanced solubilization and biogas production of waste activated sludge (WAS). The effects of pretreatment factors (i.e. temperature and H O-2 (2) concentration) on the degree of WAS disintegration (DD) and biogas yield (BY) were assessed by response surface analysis within the design space of 60-90 degrees C and 0-200mM H O-2 (2). Significant sludge disintegration (up to 23.0% DD) and visibly enhanced BY (up to 26.9%) were shown in the pretreatment trials. Two response surface models to describe how DD and BY respond to changes in the pretreatment conditions were successfully constructed (R-2>0.95, p<0.05). The models showed totally different response surface shapes, indicating the DD and BY were influenced by pretreatment conditions in very different ways. DD was dominantly affected by temperature and showed higher model responses at the high-temperature region, while the BY response peaked in the low-temperature and mid-level H O-2 (2) region. This observation implies that the enhanced solubilization of WAS was not directly translated into an increase in biogas production. Our results showed that WAS can be efficiently disintegrated by H O-2 (2) oxidation under mild-temperature conditions for enhanced anaerobic digestibility. Within the explored region of pretreatment conditions, the maximum BY was estimated to be 82.1mL/gCOD(added) (32.8% greater than the untreated control) at (60.0 degrees C, 74.2mM H O-2 (2)).","Jung, H; Kim, J; Lee, S; Lee, C",response surface analysis; anaerobic digestion; pretreatment; hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2); waste activated sludge,2014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2014.880517,Chemical,oxidizer,peroxide h2o2,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Energy efficiency improvement of thermal hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion of Posidonia oceanica residues,"Posidonia oceanica is the most abundant aquatic plant of the Mediterranean Sea where it plays great ecological importance. The accumulation of residues along the shore, however, creates a littering hardship for the territory due to their bad rotting smell and introduces an obstacle to the enjoyment of the beaches and tourist swimming. Posidonia oceanica residues may be valorized producing bioenergy by anaerobic digestion. Due to its high lignin content, however, a pretreatment step is required for enhance energy recovery. In the present study the effects of acid addition in the thermal hydrolysis step were evaluated in terms of energy balance, biogas production and solids reduction. The results obtained have shown that when thermal pretreatment was enhanced by adding hydrochloric acid (0.4% w/w), an improvement in methane production of 575% was obtained compared to thermal pretreatment only with specific biogas production as high as 0.241 +/- 0.065 Nm(3) per kgVS of wet Posidonia or 0.138 +/- 0.056 Nm(3) CH4/kgVS. This result was ascribed to the defibration of lignocellulosic components operated by acidic thermal pretreatment which allowed the removal of 74%, 70% and 24% of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, respectively, during anaerobic digestion. The energy analysis carried out for treatment plants with capacity of 10 and 50 m(3)/d has shown that acid addition in the thermal hydrolysis step allows the energy balance to turn from extremely negative (energy demand is 8 to 10 times greater than the one produced) to positive values, with process energy efficiencies ranging from 22 to 35% with regards to the size of the plant.","De Sanctis, M; Chimienti, S; Pastore, C; Piergrossi, V; Di Iaconi, C",Acidic thermal pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Lignocellulosic biomass; Posidonia oceanica; Energy balance; Process energy efficiency,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113457,Physical,thermal,thermal hydrolysis,lignocellulose,posidonia,plant,,,,,,,,

The energy analysis carried out for treatment plants with capacity of 10 and 50 m(3)/d has shown that acid addition in the thermal hydrolysis step allows the energy balance to turn from extremely negative (energy demand is 8 to 10 times greater than the one produced) to positive values, with process energy efficiencies ranging from 22 to 35% with regards to the size of the plant.","De Sanctis, M; Chimienti, S; Pastore, C; Piergrossi, V; Di Iaconi, C",Acidic thermal pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Lignocellulosic biomass; Posidonia oceanica; Energy balance; Process energy efficiency,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113457,Chemical,acidic,hcl,lignocellulose,posidonia,plant,,,,,,,,
Thermo-chemo-sonic pretreatment of lignocellulosic waste: Evaluating anaerobic biodegradability and environmental impacts,"In the present study, yard waste was pretreated by thermo-chemo-sonic pretreatment prior to anaerobic digestion to improve its anaerobic biodegradability. First, the pretreatment conditions were optimized using Box-Behnken design based response surface methodology for the maximum organic matter solubilisation. Then, the possible mechanism of delignification by thermo-chemo-sonic pretreatment was discussed. Moreover, the anaerobic digestion performance of untreated yard waste (UYW) and pretreated yard waste (PYW) was compared. The optimum pretreatment condition based on the increase in soluble COD and volatile solids (VS) was: 2997 kJ/kgTS ultrasonic energy, 74 degrees C, and 10.1 pH.

Combinations of fungal and milling pretreatments for enhancing rice straw biogas production during solid-state anaerobic digestion,"Rice straw was pretreated by different combinations of physical (milling) and biological (incubation with Pleurotus ostreatus fungus) treatment to improve its biodegradability and biogas production during solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD). Effects of milling (62 mm) and incubation time (10, 20 and 30 d), on lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose degradation during fungal pretreatment and methane yield during digestion were assessed by comparison with untreated rice straw. Both incubation time and milling had significant impacts on both lignin removal during fungal pre-treatment and methane yield during digestion. A combination of fungal pretreatment at 30 days followed by milling prior to anaerobic digestion resulted in 30.4% lignin removal, the highest selectivity value (the ratio between relative lignin removal and relative cellulose removal) of 4.22, and the highest methane yield of 258 L/kg VS.

Effect of Mild-Temperature Thermo-Alkaline Pretreatment on the Solubilization and Anaerobic Digestion of Spent Coffee Grounds,"Mild-temperature thermo-alkaline pretreatment of spent coffee grounds (SCG) was studied to improve its solubilization and methanation. The simultaneous effects of NaOH concentration (0-0.2 M) and temperature (60-90 degrees C) were investigated. Significant solubilization of SCG was achieved by the pretreatment, particularly under high-NaOH-concentration and high-temperature conditions. However, adding NaOH above a certain concentration adversely affected the methane production. Therefore, the degree of solubilization (SD) correlated poorly with methane yield (Ym). Response surface models of SD and Ym were successfully generated. The maximum response of SD (36.4%) was obtained at 0.18 M NaOH and 90.0 degrees C, while that of Ym (263.31 mL CH4/g COD added) was obtained at 0.13 M NaOH and 70.5 degrees C.

"Strategies to Optimize Microalgae Conversion to Biogas: Co-Digestion, Pretreatment and Hydraulic Retention Time","This study aims at optimizing the anaerobic digestion (AD) of biomass in microalgal-based wastewater treatment systems. It comprises the co-digestion of microalgae with primary sludge, the thermal pretreatment (75 degrees C for 10 h) of microalgae and the role of the hydraulic retention time (HRT) in anaerobic digesters. Initially, a batch test comparing different microalgae (untreated and pretreated) and primary sludge proportions showed how the co-digestion improved the AD kinetics. The highest methane yield was observed by adding 75% of primary sludge to pretreated microalgae (339 mL CH4/g VS). This condition was then investigated in mesophilic lab-scale reactors. The average methane yield was 0.46 L CH4/g VS, which represented a 2.9-fold increase compared to pretreated microalgae mono-digestion. Conversely, microalgae showed a low methane yield despite the thermal pretreatment (0.16 L CH4/g VS). Indeed, microscopic analysis confirmed the presence of microalgae species with resistant cell walls (i.e., Stigioclonium sp. and diatoms). In order to improve their anaerobic biodegradability, the HRT was increased from 20 to 30 days, which led to a 50% methane yield increase. Overall, microalgae AD was substantially improved by the co-digestion with primary sludge, even without pretreatment, and increasing the HRT enhanced the AD of microalgae with resistant cell walls.","Sole-Bundo, M; Salvado, H; Passos, F; Garfi, M; Ferrer, I",anaerobic digestion; bioenergy; co-digestion; hydraulic retention time; microalgal biomass; primary sludge; thermal pretreatment,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules23092096,Physical,thermal,,micro-algae,pond,,,,,,,,,
Fungal pretreatment of rice straw with Pleurotus ostreatus and Trichoderma reesei to enhance methane production under solid-state anaerobic digestion,"Rice straw was subjected to fungal pretreatment using Pleurotus ostreatus and Trichoderma reesei to improve its biodegradability and methane production via solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD). Effects of moisture content (65%, 75% and 85%), and incubation time (10, 20 and 30 d) on lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose degradation during fungal pretreatment and methane yield during anaerobic digestion were assessed via comparison to untreated rice straw. Pretreatment with P. ostreatus was most effective at 75% moisture content and 20 d incubation resulting in 33.4% lignin removal and a lignin/cellulose removal ratio (selectivity) of 4.2. In comparison Trichoderma reesei was most effective at 75% moisture content and 20 d incubation resulting in 23.6% lignin removal and a lignin/cellulose removal ratio (selectivity) of 2.88. The corresponding methane yields were 263 and 214 L/kg volatile solids (VS), which were 120% and 78.3% higher than for the untreated rice straw, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Enhancement of methane production from high solid anaerobic digestion of pretreated palm oil decanter cake using a modified solid inclined reactor,"BACKGROUND The potential of methane production from high solid anaerobic digestion (AD) of oil palm decanter cake (OPDC) in a laboratory-scale modified solid inclined (MSI) reactor was investigated. The OPDC was pretreated with liquid hot water (LHW) before being fed to the MSI reactor which operated under high solid content (21% total solids, TS) with leachate recirculation once a day at ambient temperature. The result was compared to the non-pretreated OPDC. The performance of the MSI reactor was evaluated in term of the percentages of solid reduction, methane production rate and yield including removal of organic solids (lignocelluloses and oil and grease). The process stability was also monitored. RESULTS Pretreatment of OPDC with LHW (OPDC-P) influenced lignocellulosic materials by increasing decrystalline cellulose from 50.6 to 28.9% and partial solubilization by reduction of hemicellulose and lignin from 7.6 to 4.9 and 10.6 to 9.5%, respectively. It was found that the chemical oxygen demand (COD) in OPDC-P was increased from 28.5.9 to 62.95 g.L-1. The methane yield and rate of OPDC-P from the anaerobic MSI reactor were as high as 411 L kg(-1)VS(added) and 23.8 L d(-1)(respectively) within a short time of only 15 days compared to corresponding values for nonpretreated OPDC of 245 L kg(-1)VS(added) and 4.9 L d(-1) within 50 days. The MSI reactor had high stability within a pH range of 7-8 and a TVA:alkalinity ratio of 0.1-0.2. CONCLUSION The anaerobic MSI reactor was able to handle high solid content at 21% of OPDC with high performance and stability within a short incubation time. This reactor could be implemented and promoted to utilize solid waste in the palm oil industry.

The origin of waste activated sludge affects the enhancement of anaerobic digestion by free nitrous acid pre-treatment,"Anaerobic digestion is a common stabilization method for treating primary sludge (PS) and waste activated sludge (WAS). However, its application is often limited by the degradation of WAS. Recent studies have demonstrated FNA to be an effective pre-treatment for enhancing WAS degradability, while having limited effect on PS degradability. WAS characteristics are impacted by wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) configuration and this study is the first to compare the effectiveness of FNA pre-treatment on WAS from WWTP with and without primary treatment. In this study, WAS samples were collected from four full-scale WWTPs with or without primary treatment. Sludge characterization, biomethane potential tests and mathematical modeling were conducted to assess the impacts of FNA pre-treatment on anaerobic digestion. The results showed that FNA pre-treatment was consistently effective for WAS from different WWTPs, while the extent of enhancement varied between WWTPs. For WAS from WWTPs without primary treatment, FNA pretreatment increased the rate of hydrolysis by 54-66% compared to 22-33% increase for WAS without primary treatment. In contrast, WAS from WWTPs with primary treatment experienced greater increases in methane potential (22-24%) compared to WAS from WWTPs without primary treatment (14-16%). These variances could be associated with primary treatment impacting the wastewater COD/N ratio and thus portion of extracellular polymetric substances (EPS) and cells in WAS. FNA pre-treatment targets the destruction of polymetric substances and cells, therefore WAS with a higher proportion of cells (i.e., WAS with primary treatment) experienced greater improvements in methane yield. Similarly, greater improvements in hydrolysis rate were observed for WAS from WWTP without primary sedimentation which contain higher proportions of large EPS molecules. Despite its consistent effectiveness on WAS samples, FNA pre-treatment was ineffective for improving the digestibility of high-rate activated sludge (HRAS). (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Downstream augmentation of hydrothermal carbonization with anaerobic digestion for integrated biogas and hydrochar production from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste: A circular economy concept,"Developing a treatment technology which minimizes the production of by-product (waste) is need of an hour. In this study, municipal yard waste (primary raw material) was microwave-pretreated before anaerobic digestion (AD) to improve biogas production. The anaerobically digested, Pretreated Yard Waste (PTY) and the Untreated Yard Waste (UTY) (waste/secondary raw material) was Hydrothermally Carbonized as a downstream treatment technique to produce energy rich hydrochar. The Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) was conducted at a temperature of 180 degrees C and 200 degrees C for 6 h to produce carbon-rich hydrochar. Physicochemical, structural and combustion properties of PTY and UTY hydrochar were characterized and compared using a range of techniques to gain detailed insight into individual hydrochar samples. Microwave pretreatment of yard waste enhanced the biogas production from 264 +/- 11 mL/g VS to 370 +/- 14 mL/g VS. The carbon content and higher heating value of digestate increased considerably from 44 and 44.35% to 53-56% and 15-16 MJ/kg to 21-23 MJ/kg, respectively after HTC. Thermal gravimetric analysis of the prepared hydrochar showed that the high-temperature carbonization increased the combustion properties of hydrochar. The hydrochar prepared from PTY showed enhanced physicochemical, structural and combustion properties as compared to hydrochar prepared from UTY. The finding asserted that the pretreatment of yard waste before AD not only improved biogas production but also improved yield with better quality hydrochar when its resulting digestate was hydrothermally carbonized. AD of yard waste yields biogas and HTC of the resulting digestate yields hydrochar; both are biofuel, hence, augmenting HTC as a downstream treatment process along with AD would result in the creation of near-zero loss process.

Hygienization performances of innovative sludge treatment solutions to assure safe land spreading,"The present research aims at the evaluation of the hygienization performances of innovative sludge treatment processes applied for the separated treatment of secondary sludge. Namely, two digestion pretreatments (sonication and thermal hydrolysis) and two sequential biological processes (mesophilic/thermophilic and anaerobic/aerobic digestion) were compared to the mesophilic (MAD) and thermophilic anaerobic digestion (TAD). Microbial indicators (Escherichia coli, somatic coliphages and Clostridium perfringens spores) and pathogens (Salmonella and enteroviruses), which show different resistances to treatment processes, were monitored in untreated and treated sludge. Overall, microbial load in secondary sludge was shown to be similar or lower than previously reported in literature for mixed sludge. Notably, the anaerobic/aerobic digestion process increased the removal of E. coli and somatic coliphages compared to the simple MAD and always achieved the hygienization requirement (2-log-unit removal of E. coli) proposed by EU Commission in the 3rd Working Document on sludge (April 2000) for the use of treated sludges in agriculture with restriction on their application. The microbial quality limits for the unrestricted use of sludge in agriculture (no Salmonella in 50 g wet weight (WW) and E. coli <500 CFU/g) were always met when thermal digestion or pretreatment was applied; however, the required removal level (6-log-unit removal of E. coli) could not be assessed due to the low level of this microorganism in raw sludge.

Techno-economic and environmental impact assessment of biogas production and fertiliser recovery from pelagic Sargassum: A biorefinery concept for Barbados,"Pelagic Sargassum inundation of coastlines across the North Atlantic is an ongoing challenge but presents new opportunities for value-added resource recovery. This study assessed the techno-economic feasibility and environmental impact of utilising these invasive brown seaweed, and food waste as feedstock for energy production and fertiliser recovery in Barbados. The biorefinery concept evaluated was designed with hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) and anaerobic digestion (AD) technologies. Financial analyses of four varied feedstock and process scenarios (S1-S4) established a linear relationship between profitability and the sale of products (electricity and fertiliser). In all cases, simple sale of power generated to the national grid resulted in a negative cash flow and required the introduction of fertiliser sales to achieve positive cash flows. Moreover, the net loss in the electricity only scenarios exceeded that of the landfill disposal, the present operation employed on the island for Sargassum management. The addition of the solid digestate to the revenue stream increased the profit margin and financial attractiveness of the process. Maximum income generation could be attained through 100% supply of the digestate to international markets. However, this approach provides zero support to local food security. The preferred option involves the 50/50 split utilisation of the solid digestate in local and international agricultural practice. While HTP is energy-intensive technology, the recirculation of waste heat generated by a combined heat and power unit for HTP reduced the input energy demand. It also lowered the potential environmental impact by more than 10-fold, relative to landfill disposal. Recycling of the liquid digestate also reduced the fresh water demand and its associated costs. Despite the promising results, process scale-up and commercialisation remain a main challenge, primarily due to the seasonality and variability of Sargassum seaweed for continuous bioprocessing.","Thompson, TM; Ramin, P; Udugama, I; Young, BR; Gernaey, KV; Baroutian, S",Anaerobic digestion; Environmental impact analysis; Food waste; Hydrothermal&nbsp; pretreatment; Pelagic Sargassum; Techno-economic assessment,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2021.114605,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,algae,sargassum,,,,,,,,,
Ozonation as a Pre-treatment for Anaerobic Digestion of Waste-Activated Sludge: Effect of the Ozone Doses,"The aim of the present study was to improve the anaerobic biodegradability of waste-activated sludge by using ozonation. The effect of different ozone doses was assessed in terms of biogas production, maximum biogas production rate, and concentration of amino acids and long-chain fatty acids in the waste-activated sludge. Four different doses were used: 0.043 gO(3) g(TSS)(-1), 0.063 gO(3) g(TSS)(-1), 0.080 gO(3) g(TSS)(-1), and 0.100 gO(3) g(TSS)(-1). The lower doses resulted in biogas production increases and a higher maximum biogas production rate in the anaerobic digestion of waste-activated sludge, while the contrary occurred at higher doses. The amino acids and long-chain fatty acids concentrations decreased when the ozone dose increased. The correlation with the ozone dose was nonlinear for amino acids and linear for long-chain fatty acids. The reaction products of long-chain fatty acids (aldehydes) are proposed as the cause of inhibition observed in the anaerobic digestion of waste-activated sludge treated with higher ozone doses.","Silvestre, G; Ruiz, B; Fiter, M; Ferrer, C; Berlanga, JG; Alonso, S; Canut, A",Waste-Activated Sludge; Secondary Sludge; preTreatment; Amino Acids; Anaerobic Digestion; Ozone; Long-Chain Fatty Acids,2015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01919512.2014.985817,Chemical,oxidizer,ozone,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
"Influences of organic loading, feed-to-inoculum ratio, and different pretreatment strategies on the methane production performance of eggplant stalk","A large amount of eggplant stalk (ES) is incinerated after harvesting of eggplant every year, which aggravates environmental pollution and waste of resources. Converting ES into methane through anaerobic digestion (AD) technology may be a potential treatment method, considering the low environmental impact and high energy recovery. Firstly, this study explored the effects of organic loading (OL) and feed to inoculum ratio (F/I ratio) on the AD of ES by response surface methodology (RSM). In order to achieve higher AD efficiency, various pretreatments (acid, alkali, alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP), microwave, and ultrasound) were introduced and comprehensively assessed with regard to methane production, organic matter destruction, and kinetic parameters. Results showed that OL had a more significant impact on AD process compared to F/I ratio and methane production was enhanced remarkably when the OL and F/I ratio were 35.0 g VS/L and 3.0, respectively. XRD, FTIR, and SEM analyses of pretreated ES showed that alkali and AHP pretreatments performed better in delignification. Under optimal conditions, the ES pretreated with 1.5% AHP (adjusted by KOH) performed the maximum methane production of 262.2 mL/g VS with a biodegradability of 95.0%, which increased by 334.1% compared to untreated ES.

Pre-separation of ammonium content during high solid thermal-alkaline pretreatment to mitigate ammonia inhibition: Kinetics and feasibility analysis,"The feasibility of ammonia pre-separation during the thermal-alkaline pretreatment (TAP) of waste activated sludge was evaluated to mitigate ammonia inhibition during high solid anaerobic digestion (HSAD). The results showed that the TAP increased the organics hydrolysis rate as much as 77% compared to the thermal hydrolysis pretreatment (THP). The production and separation of the ammonia during the TAP exhibited a linear relationship with the hydrolysis of organics and the Emerson model. The pre-separation ratio of the free ammonia nitrogen exceeded 98.00% at a lime dosage exceeding 0.021 g CaO/g TS. However, the separation ratio of the total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) was hindered by its production ratio. Compared to the THP, the TAP increased the methane production rate under similar production yield.

Improvement of solid-state anaerobic digestion of broiler farm-derived waste via fungal pretreatment,"Fungus, Trichoderma longibrachiatum, was used for the pretreatment of broiler farm derived-lignocellulosic bedding material (rice husk) to enhance the subsequent solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD). Fungal pretreatment efficacy was evaluated through a series of batch studies with respect to carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio and pretreatment time. Lignocellulosic outer layer structure disruption of the rice husk was prominent under the best fungal pretreatment condition evaluated (C/N ratio of 18.9 and pretreatment time of 7 days). Consequently, the resulting methane yield of 438.1 +/- 20.0 NmL/gVS(added) was obtained which was similar to 2.0-folds higher than that of the control (without pretreatment). Furthermore, in semi-continuous SS-AD, fungal pretreatment could significantly enhance digestibility of organic substance in high solid loading (30% total solids) AD process by 3.2-folds and improve microbial kinetic parameters with subsequent daily methane yield improvement by 2.4-folds. Thus, fungal pretreatment could be an environmentally-friendly and effective low-cost approach for broiler farmderived waste management to enhance SS-AD efficacy.","Chaitanoo, N; Aggarangsi, P; Nitayavardhana, S",Fungal pretreatment; Trichoderma longibrachiatum; Broiler farm-derived waste; Solid-state anaerobic digestion; Lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.125146,Biological,fungi,Trichoderma longibrachiatum,manure,chicken,litter,84,80.6,,,18.9,25,10.6,19.5
Reduction of the environmental footprint of thermo-alkali pretreatment by reusing black liquor during anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic biomasses,"In this study, the effect of thermo-alkaline pretreatment and recycling of the liquid fraction (black liquor) for successive pretreatment steps on chemical composition and methane yields from horse manure was investigated. At first, horse manure was subjected to alkaline pretreatment at 70 degrees C for 1 h (8.6 g NaOH/100 g total solids). Pretreated biomass was then separated into solid and liquid fractions (black liquor). In the subsequent stages, black liquor was mixed with 20% (v/v) of fresh NaOH and was reused to pretreat subsequent batches of horse manure (cycles 1-4). Chemical analyses showed that thermo-alkaline pretreatment was effective in the delignification and solubilization of organic matter and thereby increased the holocellulose (cellulose and hemicelluloses) content in the solid fraction of horse manure. On comparison with untreated horse manure methane yields (225 +/- 1 L CH4 kg(-1) VSadded), thermo-alkaline pretreatment improved the methane yields of horse manure by 39% (313 +/- 16 L CH4 kg(-1) VSadded). However, the effectiveness of black liquor recycling on methane production decreased (from 39 to 12%) with an increase in the number of recycling steps (from 1 to 4). Nevertheless, recycling of black liquor reduced the consumption of NaOH (40%) and water use (60%). Thus, thermo-alkaline pretreatment with liquor recycling was found to be an effective pretreatment with an economic gain of 2.4 to 10.4 compared to pretreatment without recycling.

Food waste enhanced anaerobic digestion of biologically pretreated yard waste: Analysis of cellulose crystallinity and microbial communities,"Solid waste treatment through anaerobic digestion (AD) technology contributes to energy recycling and reuse of various solid organic wastes. However, yard waste (YW) is generally recalcitrant to AD due to the presence of high cellulose and hemicellulose content, which are difficult to be hydrolyzed. In this study, to enhance hydrolysis efficiency, YW was biologically pretreated with digested sludge and supplemented with food waste (FW) before AD process. Effects of FW supplementation on pH, SCOD, cellulose and hemicellulose content and cellulose crystallinity were examined. The optimal amount of FW supplementation was determined to be 10 wt%. An increase of 6.5-20.3% in cellulose reduction and an increase of 14.8-53.1% in hemicellulose reduction in digesters was achieved within the optimal pretreatment time of 4 days. After hydrolysis, cellulose crystallinity decreased by 23% from 71% in the control digester, which was responsible for improved biodegradability of cellulose in YW. FT-IR analysis of hydrolysis mixture confirmed that partial hydrogen bonds were destroyed in digesters with supplementation of 10 wt% FW, leading to a higher extent of degradation of the feedstock. In the batch AD of FW supplemented YW, results indicated that methane yield was 35% higher than that of the control digester without FW supplementation. Pyrosequencing analysis indicated that the abundance of bacterial genus Sphaerochaeta and Cellulosibacter in subsequent digestion were enhanced by 10- and 5-folds by 10 wt% FW supplementation, respectively, and were deemed to be responsible for the enhanced anaerobic digestion performance.

"Evaluation of thermal pretreatment and digestion temperature rise in a biogas fueled combined cooling, heat, and power system using exergo-economic analysis","In a municipal wastewater treatment plant, the anaerobic digesters are able to support the whole or a portion of the required fuel to offset the energy demand. Also, by implementing some techniques on municipal sewage sludge, leading to biomethane productivity enhancement, it is possible to generate surplus power. In this work, using batch biomethane potential assays, thermal pretreatment at 70 degrees C & 90 degrees C for the durations of 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 4 h, and digestion temperature rise from the mesophilic to the thermophilic conditions have been studied to boost the biomethane productivity of the sewage sludge. Also a combined cooling, heat, and power generating plant was suggested to evaluate the techniques thermo-economically. It was shown that, compared to the non-treated mesophilic digestion of the sewage sludge, thermal pretreatment at 70 degrees C and 90 degrees C for 0.5 h, and thermophilic digestion were able to raise the biomethane productivity by 13.63%, 29.82%, and 160.8%, respectively. In this regard, the thermodynamic and the thermo- economic model of the plant was developed. The energy analysis of the system revealed that not only the studied methods, but also the mesophilic digestion of the non-treated sewage sludge result in a positive energy recovery balance in the plant. The exergo-economic analysis indicated that the major origin of cost in the system is the anaerobic digester. Implementing thermal pretreatment at 90 degrees C for 30 min and digestion temperature rise led to decrease in the required volume of the digester, and subsequently, in the total system cost rate. Additionally, all the applied techniques provided more fuel compared to the non-treated mesophilic case, and consequently they could reduce the levelized cost of energy in the plant. Among the studied techniques, the most effective one was digestion temperature rise which decreased the total cost rate and the levelized cost of energy by 30.31% and 41.29%, respectively.","Mirmasoumi, S; Saray, RK; Ebrahimi, S",Anaerobic digestion; CCHP plant; Digestion temperature rise; Exergo-economic analysis; Municipal sewage sludge; Thermal pretreatment,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.02.069,Physical,thermal,,activated sludge,municipal wastewater sludge,,,,,,,,,
Molecular mechanisms of interaction between enzymes and Maillard reaction products formed from thermal hydrolysis pretreatment of waste activated sludge,"Thermal hydrolysis pretreatment (THP) is often used to improve the anaerobic digestion performance of waste activated sludge (WAS) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). During the THP process, the proteins and polysaccharides in the biomass will undergo hydrolysis and Maillard reaction, producing biorefractory organic substances, such as recalcitrant dissolved organic nitrogen (rDON) and melanoidins. In this study, a series of spectroscopy methods were used to quantitatively analyze the Maillard reaction of glucose and lysine, and the interaction mechanisms of the Maillard reaction products (MRPs) and lysozyme were investigated. Results showed that the typical aromatic heterocyclic structures in MRPs, such as pyrazine and furan, were found to quench molecular fluorescence of lysozyme, resulting in an unfolding of standard protein structure and increase in lysozyme hydrophobicity. Significant loss of enzyme activity was detected during this process. Thermodynamic parameters obtained from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) confirmed that the interaction between MRPs and lysozyme occurred both exothermically and spontaneously. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the molecular interactions of MRPs and protein included parallel dislocation aromatic stacking, T-shaped vertical aromatic stacking, H-bond and H-bond coupled to aromatic stacking.","Wang, QD; Xu, QY; Wang, HD; Han, B; Xia, DS; Wang, DS; Zhang, WJ",Waste activated sludge; Thermal hydrolysis pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Maillard reaction products; Enzyme activity; Molecular interaction,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.117777,Physical,thermal,thermal hydrolysis,activated sludge,waste activate sludge,,,,,,,,,
Pretreatment and Multi-Feed Anaerobic Co-digestion of Agro-Industrial Residual Biomass for Improved Biomethanation and Kinetic Analysis,"Batch biochemical methane potential (BMP) test of agro-industrial, agricultural, and municipal solid waste (MSW) individuals like groundnut straw, rice bran, and guar husk, mung bean husk (MBH), wheat straw (WS), and organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), under mesophilic conditions, were performed to evaluate the biogas potential. BMP test for multi-feed anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) of WS, OFMSW, and MBH at five mixing ratio was performed to evaluate the synergistic effect of multi feed-stocks of blending the feedstocks. Mixture ratio having OFMSW:WS:MBH of 25:5:70% composition resulted into 37, 20, and 4% higher methane yield up to 280 ml/g Volatile solid (VS) in comparison with mono-digestion of OFMSW, WS and MBH. Ultrasonic pretreatment was also performed and the experimental results showed that varying the sonication time have a significant improvement on substrate's biodegradation and solubilization augmenting the methane yield from OFMSW, WS, and MBH by 71, 75, and 46%, respectively at sonication period of 60 min. Effect of pretreatment on the substrate studied through Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), XRD and FT-IR analysis. Cone and Exponential models showed an average coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.9855 and R-2 = 0.9893, respectively, and RMSE values for cone model was lower than that of Exponential model showing Cone model was more precised.","Prajapati, KK; Pareek, N; Vivekanand, V",agricultural waste; agro-industrial waste; organic fraction of municipal solid waste; anaerobic digestion; ultrasonic pretreatment; kinetics,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenrg.2018.00111,Physical,ultrasonic,,ofmsw,organic municipal solid waste,,,,,,,,,

Organic loading rates (OLRs) in the range of 2.0-7.0 g VS/(L d) were tested after the pretreatment and the breakage of complex organic matter. Total and soluble chemical oxygen demand (CODt and CODs) removal efficiencies decreased slightly between 77.9-71.7% and 92.3-85.0% when the OLR increased from 2 to 5 g VS/(L d). However, when the OLR increased to 7.0, a sudden decrease in process performance was observed. The maximum methane production rate (1.72 L CH4/(L d)) was achieved at an OLR of 4.5 g VS/(L d). This value was 39.8% higher than that obtained in the semi-continuous anaerobic digestion of untreated TPOP at the same OLR. The modified Stover-Kicannon model and the Grau second-order kinetic model were found to be adequate to fit the experimental results of CODt and CODs, respectively.

Optimum energy integration of thermal hydrolysis through pinch analysis,"Anaerobic digestion, a well-established technology to generate biogas from sewage sludge, is constrained by the hydrolysis (or solubilization) stage. Several pretreatments attempt to overcome this limitation, with thermal hydrolysis emerging as the technology of choice due to its techno-economic advantages. The objective of this work is to optimize the integration of this energy intensive pretreatment within the wastewater treatment plant, ensuring that the digestion performance improves in an energy-efficient way. By applying pinch analysis, a methodology to optimize energy systems, a strategy is suggested that selects a second-generation thermal hydrolysis technology designed to recover all process vapors, defines the optimum combined heat and power scheme to ensure an efficient integration and determines the minimum sludge feed concentration to guarantee energy self-sufficiency, the recovery of all waste heat and the minimization of expensive polyelectrolyte use.

Dilute acid pretreatment of Hippophae rhamnoeides prunings towards their biotechnological exploitation through anaerobic digestion,"Agricultural pruning residues represent an emerging type of by-products very poorly attended so far, usually incinerated in the open fields where they are produced, this way provoking negative environmental effects and facilitating the loss of valuable resources. The present study examines the potential exploitation of Hippophae rhamnoeides (sea buckthorn) pruning, a poorly exploited substrate, the fruits of which have been widely used for dietary supplement production, and thus its cultivation has significantly grown. The study conducted dilute acid pretreatment followed by anaerobic digestion towards the production of biogas (methane). Initially, a parametric analysis was carried out to establish the optimum pretreatment conditions, enabling partially hemicellulose depolymerization from the original feedstock. It was found that the parameters of solids loading, and duration of pretreatment had a positive impact on hydrolysis, leading to maximum overall sugars yield of 19.00 +/- 2.14% (per g of biomass) under 30% loading (w/v), 121 degrees C, 2% H3PO4, and 120-min hydrolysis conditions. However, higher temperature and acid concentration were not equally effective in enhancing hydrolysis yields under the conditions tested. Next, study of acid pretreatment with response surface methodology (RSM) and biochemical methane potential (BMP) assays were employed to evaluate the potential of the treated feedstock for biogas production. As a result of the high lignin content of the substrate, as well as possible toxicity and inhibition phenomena due to the acid hydrolysis conditions, the maximum BMP yield obtained from the tests was equal to the yield of the untreated substrate (225.30 mL CH4/g VSadded). Concerning the tested factors, even if none of them alone exhibited statistically significant differences in the results, the combination of acid concentration and time seems to have considerably affected the obtained yields.","Papavasileiou, P; Zervou, ME; Tsigkou, K; Koutra, E; Birbas, E; Kornaros, M",Chemical pretreatment; Lignocellulosic biomass; Hippophae rhamnoeides prunings; Anaerobic digestion; Biochemical methane potential (BMP) assays; Circular economy,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13399-022-02869-4,Chemical,acidic,h3po4,lignocellulose,buckthorns,prunings,,,,,,,,
"Two-phase anaerobic digestion of municipal solid wastes enhanced by hydrothermal pretreatment: Viability, performance and microbial community evaluation","The viability of hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) to improve the efficiency of biogas production from municipal solid wastes (MSWs) is uncertain because there is always a trade-off between organic matters hydrolysis and recalcitrant melanoidins formation when applying HTP on different solid wastes. In this study, MSWs including waste activated sludge, fruit and vegetable residues, and kitchen wastes, with and without HTP were digested in the one phase and two-phase anaerobic digesters, respectively. Although the specific biogas production of MSWs in two-phase anaerobic digestion was significantly enhanced by HTP, no benefit could be found in one-phase anaerobic digestion because of the melanoidins formation. The specific biogas production of hydrothermally pretreated MSWs was much higher in two-phase anaerobic digestion (0.71 L biogas/g VSadded) than that of MSWs in one-phase anaerobic digestion with or without HTP (0.53 L and 0.55 L biogasig VSadded) when the butyric acid type fermentation dominated in the acidogenic phase. These findings indicated that the recalcitrant melanoidins formed in the HTP process were probably removed in the acidogenic digester. Differing from previous study, mixed-acid type fermentation, rather than ethanol type fermentation, was observed in the acidogenic digester fed with hydrothermally pretreated feedstock when pH was adjusted in the range of 4.0-4.5 with high oxidation reduction potential values of 49-97 my. The succeeding specific biogas production of mixed-acid type feedstock was only 0.59 L biogas/g VSadded, which was lower than that of the butyric acid type feedstock. Microbial community structure was independent of the pH valties and was substrate-specific in the acidogenic digesters. In the acidogenic digester with the HTP substrate, the phylum Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes increased, thereby possibly resulting from the increased content of soluble sugar and proteins in the HTP feedstock. Energy balance estimation of the four defined scenarios indicated that the combined HTP and two-phase AD in the MSWs treatment can achieve higher net energy output by 50.5-97.4% compared to the other three scenarios. This enables the combined process of HTP and two-phase AD to be a promising alternative way in the treatment of feedstock rich in protein and sugar. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Enhancing methane production of anaerobic digested sewage sludge by advanced wet oxidation & steam explosion pretreatment,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) of sewage sludge is associated with lowered carbon conversion efficiency due to the recalcitrance of microbial cells in the Waste Activated Sludge (WAS) from the aeration basins with 50 % of the dry weight still being present after AD. The effect of Advanced Wet Oxidation & Steam Explosion (AWOEx) pretreatment on the methane yield at variable temperatures (165-200.C), residence time (15-45 min) and oxygen dosage (1%-10% based on VS concentration) was tested in this study. Central composite design (JMP (R) Pro) was used to design 19 runs of AWOEx pretreatment of dewatered digested sewage sludge (DADSS) at different operating conditions. After pretreatment the DADSS was fed to 19 bioreactors operated in semi-continues mode at 37 degrees C. The highest average methane yields of 183 mL/g VS and 170 mL/g VS were found for the bioreactors receiving DADSS pretreated at 165. C with a retention time of 15 min and 10 % O-2 (Condition 1), and, 182.5 degrees C with a retention time of 15 min and 5.5 % O-2 (Condition 2). This corresponds to an increase in the methane production of 156.2 % and 140.5 % compared to the methane production from the DADSS without pretreatment. Plotting the results using the response surface model showed that temperature and O-2 dosage had a significant effect on the methane yield while residence time was of lower importance. Importantly, thermic treatment without oxygen showed far lower methane yields of 114.5 mL/gVS and 120.26 mL/gVS, respectively of the two best conditions described above. Through this two-step AD process, we were able to achieve a net 94% improved methane yield compared to conventional AD of sewage sludge by implementing a second AWOEx pretreatment step (followed by secondary AD) with 26.9% decreased organics content, further reducing the cost of the final disposal of the treated sewage sludge.

UPGRADING OF ANAEROBIC-DIGESTION OF WASTE ACTIVATED-SLUDGE BY THERMAL PRETREATMENT,"The effect of thermal pretreatment on the characteristics of degradation of waste activated slduge (WAS) in anaerobic digestion was investigated by laboratory-scale batch and continuous experiments at 35 +/- 1-degrees-C. The pretreatment temperatures of WAS ranged from 62 to 175-degrees-C and the pretreatment times were 15. 30. 60, 90 and 120 minutes. The organic particulates in WAS were solubilized to soluble carbohydrates. lipids and proteins or converted into the lower molecular weight compounds, such as volatile fatty acids. by the thermal pretreatment. Through the thermal pretreatment. the anaerobic degradability of WAS and the gas production from WAS were greatly increased. and the retention time necessary for anaerobic digestion was possible to be reduced by 5 days. The optimum pretreatment temperature and pretreatment time for the upgrading of anaerobic digestion of WAS were 170-degrees-C and 60 minutes. respectively. At this pretreatment condition, the COD removal and the gas production were markedly increased. At the digester with retention time from 5 to 10 days, the COD removal efficiency reached over 60% and gas production ranged from 223 to 235ml.gCOD-1 which were about 2 times those of the control. The numbers of methanogenic bacteria existing at retention times from 1.5 to 10.0 days ranged from 10(7) to 10(8) MPN-ml-1. and reached the maximum population level at the retention time of 5 days. The increase in solubilization and anaerobic degradation of major organic compounds in WAS by thermal pretreatment decreased in the following order: carbohydrates > proteins > lipids.","LI, YY; NOIKE, T",ANAEROBIC DIGESTION; WASTE ACTIVATED SLUDGE (WAS); THERMAL PRETREATMENT; BIODEGRADATION; SOLUBILIZATION; METHANE PRODUCTION; RETENTION TIME; METHANOGENIC BACTERIA; ENUMERATION,1992,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.1992.0466,Physical,thermal,,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Profiles and drivers of antibiotic resistance genes distribution in one-stage and two-stage sludge anaerobic digestion based on microwave-H2O2 pretreatment,"Three anaerobic digestion (AD) processes of waste activated sludge (WAS) were established including the control (mono-WAS), one-stage AD and two-stage AD along with microwave-H2O2 pre-treatment (MWH2O2) to investigate the profiles and drivers of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) distribution concerning co-selection from heavy metals, intI1 and microbial community through qPCR and high-throughput sequencing method.

Besides, AD was more effective on the potential pathogens reduction than MW-H2O2.

Enhancement on biodegradation and anaerobic digestion efficiency of activated sludge using a dual irradiation process,"A dual irradiation process involving aerobic thermophilic irradiation pretreatment (ATIP) and intermittent irradiation anaerobic digestion was developed to improve the digestion of waste-activated sludge. First, the effect of ATIP on further anaerobic digestion of activated sludge in batch mode was investigated. When exposed to ATIP for 24 h, the digestion reactor gave the highest methane yield, removed the most dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and showed the most effective reduction of VS compared to other irradiation times. This process was further enhanced by using an anaerobic fluidised-bed reactor packed with carbon felt in semi-continuous mode for digesting the pretreated activated sludge under intermittent irradiation conditions. Dual irradiation for 24 h followed by 60 min of anaerobic irradiation processing per day turned out to be optimal. This resulted in 65.3% of VS reduction, 83.9% of DOC removal ratio and 538 ml/g-VS of methane yield. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The trace metal supplementation showed limited effect on the overall performance, except for reduced volatile fatty acid concentrations in the digested sludge. The diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) technique was applied to estimate bioavailability of the trace metals in digested sludge filtrates. The DGT analysis suggests that 70-88% (96-113 mu g/L) of soluble Ni and only 5-10% (0.9-2.1 mu g/L) of soluble Co were present in a bioavailable form.

A novel pretreatment biotechnology for increasing methane yield from lipid-rich wastewater based on combination of hydrolytic enzymes with Candida rugosa fungus,"Lipid-rich wastewater from the local dairy industry (cheese whey) in the Galilee, Israel was hydrolyzed by using two different sources of lipase as hydrolytic enzymes: fungal (Candida rogusa lipase-AY) and animal porcine pancreatic lipase(PPL). Pretreatment efficiency was verified by comparative biodegradability tests of raw and treated wastewater samples. Simultaneous hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion in the same reactors were also tested. Enzymatic pretreatment of these samples at a concentration of 0.05 w v(-1) showed organic matter removal of 90% and methane formation increases of 140% for the fungal source enzyme (i.e., AY), while for the animal source enzyme (i.e., PPL) was 86 and 130%, respectively. Enzymatic pretreatment led to significant methane formation which was obtained only for moderate substrate concentration (initial chemical oxygen demand of 15 gL(-1)); While in high concentrated lipid-rich wastewater led to methane yield inhibition. The main finding was that the combination of AY enzyme with Candida rugosa fungus (i.e., enzyme mixture) led to a high efficiency in methane production (+152%) and organic materials removal (more than 90%). In summary, the use of fungal hydrolytic lipase mixed with Candida rugosa fungus is a promising method for enhancing methane production during the biodegradation of fat and grease-rich wastewaters.","Asli, S; Eid, R; Hugerat, M",Anaerobic digestion; Candida rugosa fungus; enzymatic pretreatment; fat oil and grease; lipids-rich wastewater; long-chain fatty acids,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10826068.2021.1901233,Biological,enzyme,"Candida rogusa lipase,pancreatic lipase",food waste,cheese wastewater,,,,,,,,,

Fungal Pretreatment of Willow Sawdust with Abortiporus biennis for Anaerobic Digestion: Impact of an External Nitrogen Source,"In this study the effect of nitrogen (N) supplementation in the fungal pretreatment of willow sawdust (WSD) via the white rot fungus Abortiporus biennis (A. biennis) was studied in terms of the fractionation of lignocellulosic biomass and biochemical methane potential (BMP). Thus, different external nitrogen sources (yeast extract (YE), urea (UR), and ammonium nitrate (AN)) at different ratios (N/C of 1/250 and 1/50) were added and the effect of the above parameters on the chemical composition of WSD during solid-state fermentation (SSF) experiments with A. biennis was assessed and compared to the experiment of fungal pretreatment without N supplementation (N/C was 1/500, control experiment). The results indicated that the addition of an external nitrogen source did not facilitate delignification, regardless of the type of nitrogen source and the ratio of N/C used. On the other hand, enhanced cellulose uptake was observed. Samples of the 28th day of cultivation, with and without N supplementation, were used for BMP tests, where a reduction in methane yield was observed, compared to the control experiment. In addition, a combination of fungal with alkali (20% NaOH w/w dry mass) pretreatment was performed in order to assess the effect of combined pretreatment on the lignocellulosic content and the BMP.","Alexandropoulou, M; Antonopoulou, G; Ntaikou, I; Lyberatos, G",fungal pretreatment; Abortiporus biennis; nitrogen source; delignification; willow sawdust; anaerobic digestion; methane; combined pretreatment; fungal and alkali pretreatment,2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9010130,Biological,fungi,Abortiporus biennis,wood,sawdust,,94.5,89,,,,36,21.5,29

Comparative Analysis of Bacterial and Archaeal Community Structure in Microwave Pretreated Thermophilic and Mesophilic Anaerobic Digesters Utilizing Mixed Sludge under Organic Overloading,"The effects of microwave (MW) pretreatment were investigated by six anaerobic digesters operated under thermophilic and mesophilic conditions at high organic loading rates (4.9-5.7 g volatile solids/L/d). The experiments and analyses were mainly designed to reveal the impact of MW pretreatment and digester temperatures on the process stability and microbial community structure by correlating the composition of microbial populations with volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations. A slight shift from biogas production (with a reasonable methane content) to VFA accumulation was observed in the thermophilic digesters, especially in the MW-irradiated reactors. Microbial population structure was assessed using a high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene on the MiSeq platform. Microbial community structure was slightly affected by different MW pretreatment conditions, while substantially affected by the digester temperature. The phylum Bacteroidetes proliferated in the MW-irradiated mesophilic digesters by resisting high-temperature MW (at 160 degrees C). Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (mostly the genus of Methanothermobacter) was found to be a key route of methane production in the thermophilic digesters, whereas aceticlastic methanogenesis (mostly the genus of Methanosaeta) was the main pathway in the mesophilic digesters.","Kor-Bicakci, G; Ubay-Cokgor, E; Eskicioglu, C",anaerobic digestion; municipal sludge; thermal pretreatment; microwave; microbial community structure; Illumina high-throughput sequencing; volatile fatty acids; bioenergy,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12030887,Physical,thermal,microwave,activated sludge,municipal sludge,,3.9,3.4,,,,,,
Pretreatment using UV combined with CaO2 for the anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge: Mechanistic modeling for attenuation of trace organic contaminants,"Trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) in waste active sludge (WAS) have caused many concerns due to their recalcitrance and detriment to the performance of anaerobic digestion (AD). In this study, UV (2 h) combined with calcium peroxide (CaO2, 0.1 g g(-1)-VSS (VSS, volatile suspended solid) was proposed as a suitable sludge pretreatment to enhance the AD performance with an increase in the production of maximum total short-chain fatty acids (421.3 %) and methane (119.2 %). Meanwhile, above 50 % removal efficiency for 19 detected TOrCs was achieved. UV and CaO2 had a synergistic effect on the subsequent AD of WAS. Both UV and Ca(OH)(2) produced by CaO2 played important roles in the dissolution of WAS and the subsequent AD, while UV-direct and %OH-indirect photolysis accounted for TOrCs attenuation. In order to predict TOrCs attenuation by UV/CaO2 treatment, a TOrCs photolysis model was tentatively established using carbamazepine as an indicator. This predictive model expressed a good prediction with adj-R-2 = 0.94, and the difference of predicted and measured values was within 27.3 %. This work evaluates a sludge pretreatment for simultaneously TOrCs attenuation and methane accumulation, laying foundation for promotion of sludge resource recycling.","Zheng, M; Ping, Q; Wang, L; Dai, XH; Li, YM; Snyder, SA",UV/CaO2 pretreatment; Trace organic contaminants (TOrCs); Anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge; Mechanistic model for TOrCs attenuation,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123484,Chemical,oxidizer,photooxidation UV+oxidizer peroxide cao2,activated sludge,secondary sludge,,,,,,,,,
A novel insight into the influence of thermal pretreatment temperature on the anaerobic digestion performance of floatable oil-recovered food waste: Intrinsic transformation of materials and microbial response,"The intrinsic reason determining digestion performance of 100-160 degrees C preheated food waste after recovering floatable oil (FO-recovered FW) was investigated using two-dimensional correlated infrared spectroscopy, three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy and high-throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The results indicated that thermal temperature significantly affected CH4 production of FO-recovered FW due to different structural alteration degree of starch, protein, cellulose and lipid components. Fragmentation of starch mainly occurred at 100 degrees C. The hydrolytic and acidogenic rate of starch was promoted and accordingly induced rapid growth of carbohydrate-fermenting bacteria, which resulted in severe acidification. Protein hydrolysis and cellulose H-bonds cleavage occurring at 120-160 degrees C accelerated the accessible sites interacting with microbial hydrolytic enzymes, and growth of Cloacimonetes and Syntrophomonas enhanced CH4 production. Non-degradable humic acid-like organics remarkably formed at 160 degrees C caused a carbon loss and digestion inhibiting/deteriorating. Pretreatment at 120 degrees C was feasible for promoted methane production based on energy assessment.","Qi, GX; Meng, W; Zha, J; Zhang, SM; Yu, SY; Liu, JG; Ren, LH",Food waste; Thermal pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy; Three- dimensional excitation-emission matrix; Microbial community structure,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.122021,Physical,thermal,,food waste,oil filtered,,24,22.56,,,25.6,,,
Biogas Production from Physicochemically Pretreated Grass Lawn Waste: Comparison of Different Process Schemes,"Various pretreatment methods, such as thermal, alkaline and acid, were applied on grass lawn (GL) waste and the effect of each pretreatment method on the Biochemical Methane Potential was evaluated for two options, namely using the whole slurry resulting from pretreatment or the separate solid and liquid fractions obtained. In addition, the effect of each pretreatment on carbohydrate solubilization and lignocellulossic content fractionation (to cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin) was also evaluated. The experimental results showed that the methane yield was enhanced with alkaline pretreatment and, the higher the NaOH concentration (20 g/100 gTotal Solids (TS)), the higher was the methane yield observed (427.07 L CH4/kg Volatile Solids (VS), which was almost 25.7% higher than the BMP of the untreated GL). Comparing the BMP obtained under the two options, i.e., that of the whole pretreatment slurry with the sum of the BMPs of both fractions, it was found that direct anaerobic digestion without separation of the pretreated biomass was favored, in almost all cases. A preliminary energy balance and economic assessment indicated that the process could be sustainable, leading to a positive net heat energy only when using a more concentrated pretreated slurry (i.e., 20% organic loading), or when applying NaOH pretreatment at a lower chemical loading.","Antonopoulou, G; Vayenas, D; Lyberatos, G",grass lawn waste; anaerobic digestion; biochemical methane potential; pretreatment; whole slurry; separated fractions; alkali; acid; energy balance; economical assessment,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules25020296,Physical,thermal,,lignocellulose,grass,grass,,,,,,,,

Establishing Direct Interspecies Electron Transfer during Laboratory-Scale Anaerobic Digestion of Waste Activated Sludge via Biological Ethanol-Type Fermentation Pretreatment,"Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) has been considered as an effective working mode to proceed with syntrophic metabolism, which is not yet established in the anaerobic digesters treating waste activated sludge (WAS), due to the lack of DIET-based syntrophs capable of producing the biological electrical connection and slow hydrolysis/ acidification limiting the available substrates for DIET-based syntrophic partners. A strategy of initially pretreating WAS at pH 4.0-4.5 with ethanol type fermentation enrichments (referred to as Biological Ethanol-type Fermentation Pretreatment, BEFP) for stimulating the methanogenic communities to perform DIET was proposed in this study. Under the SRT of 24 days, methane production and sludge reduction in the digesters treating WAS with BEFP were about 29.8% and 12.3% higher than that without BEFP, respectively. The digested sludge with BEFP presented a high conductance (0.9722 +/- 0.0085 uS/cm/g/L-VSS), even more conductive than the aggregates in the digester initially fed with ethanol previously reported. Together with the special enrichment of Geobacter species and high abundance of Methanothrix species, it was suggested that the DIET-based methanogenic communities were established. Further investigations to compare the pretreatment at pH 10 and BEFP revealed that, although the pretreatment at pH 10 promoted the better hydrolysis and increased the content of acetate, the slow methanogenic metabolism via the aceticlastic pathway could not yet provide the sufficient energy to support the growth of Methanothrix species and further metabolize acetate. However, the analysis of the stable carbon isotope demonstrated that the DIET-based syntrophic metabolism established with BEFP could potentially participate in acetate oxidation that supported the better growth of Methanothrix species.","Zhao, ZQ; Li, Y; He, JY; Zhang, YB",Anaerobic digestion (AD); Waste activated sludge (WAS); Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET); Biological ethanol-type fermentation pretreatment (BEFP); Methanogenesis,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b02618,Biological,anaerobic,ethanol fermentation,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Comparison of Different Pretreatments of Rice Straw Substrate to Improve Biogas Production,"Chemical and biological pretreatments (with NaOH, HCl, CO(NH2)(2) and cellulase) were used to pretreat rice straw at ambient temperature (about 20 A degrees C) to improve its biodegradability and increase anaerobic biogas production. The NaOH and CO(NH2)(2) pretreatments reduced the percentage contents of hemicellulose and lignin. The HCl pretreatment mainly dissolved the hemicellulose and resulted in decreases of 12.5-7.1% of the hemicellulose. The percentage content of cellulose showed a dramatic decrease, from 38.3 to 10.9%, after the cellulase pretreatment. Compared with untreated rice straw substrate, the total biogas yield ratios were 3.38-5.91, 1.63-2.99, 1.93-5.22 and 3.62-6.45, with a hydraulic retention time of 30 days, under NaOH, HCl, CO(NH2)(2) and cellulose pretreatments, respectively. The highest yields of biogas and methane were obtained from 40 U/g total solids (TS) cellulase-pretreated rice straw (20.433 and 9.918 L respectively).

In short, NaOH, HCl, CO(NH2)(2) and cellulase pretreatment was suitable to enhance the biogas production.

Comparison of Different Pretreatments of Rice Straw Substrate to Improve Biogas Production,"Chemical and biological pretreatments (with NaOH, HCl, CO(NH2)(2) and cellulase) were used to pretreat rice straw at ambient temperature (about 20 A degrees C) to improve its biodegradability and increase anaerobic biogas production. The NaOH and CO(NH2)(2) pretreatments reduced the percentage contents of hemicellulose and lignin. The HCl pretreatment mainly dissolved the hemicellulose and resulted in decreases of 12.5-7.1% of the hemicellulose. The percentage content of cellulose showed a dramatic decrease, from 38.3 to 10.9%, after the cellulase pretreatment.

"Thermal Hydrolysis of Sewage Sludge: A Case Study of a WWTP in Burgos, Spain","An evaluation of the energy and economic performance of thermal hydrolysis technologies is carried out on a theoretical basis. The wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of Burgos (Spain) was the base scenario of this evaluation. Energy and mass balances were established considering the registered data of primary and secondary thickened sludge in the WWTP for 2011 to 2016. These balances were analysed considering five different scenarios, taking as Scenario 1, the plant operating with conventional mesophilic digestion. The scenarios considered commercially available technologies. The best results were obtained when hydrolysis was applied to digested sludge and sludge from the Solidstream(R) process. These two scenarios showed the best performance regarding volatile solid removal and lower demand for live steam, achieving a higher amount of biogas available for valorisation using combined heat and power (CHP) units. The main advantage of the hydrolysis process is the decrease in the volume of digesters and the amount of dewatered sludge needing final disposal. The Solidstream(R) process allowed a 35% increase in biogas available for engines and a 23% increase in electricity production.","Garcia-Cascallana, J; Barrios, XG; Martinez, EJ",pretreatment; biogas enhancement; hydrolysis; energy,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app11030964,Physical,thermal,thermal hydrolysis,activated sludge,sewage sludge,,,,,,,,,

The effect of microwave pretreatment on biogas production from agricultural straws,"Biogas production from microwave-pretreated agricultural residual straws that are used as feedstock was investigated in a laboratory batch study. Barley, spring wheat, winter wheat and oat straw were examined. To investigate the effect of changing the physicochemical structure of the straws on biogas production, the pretreatment processes were applied to two sample groups. The first group contained milled straw and the second group comprised milled wet straw that was prepared by the addition of deionized water. Both groups were subjected to microwave irradiation until oven temperatures of 200 or 300 degrees C were attained. Sixty-six identical batch anaerobic reactors were run under mesophilic conditions for 60 days. Preliminary test results showed that the microwave pretreatment of the different straws did not improve their anaerobic digestion. An increase in the treatment temperature led to lower biogas production levels. An inverse relationship between the thermal conversion yield and cumulative biogas production was observed.

Enhanced methane potential of rice straw with microwave assisted pretreatment and its kinetic analysis,"Biogas has become an alternative clean source of energy. Agricultural residues being renewable and abundant resources could be efficiently used as a feed for methane production. The recalcitrant behaviour of rice straw marks pretreatment an important step to facilitate the transformation into renewable (methane) energy source. Microwave pretreatment has been considered as one of the most effective method, as it can directly (thermal and nonthermal effects) react with the feedstock and destroy its complex matrix. The present study considered the different temperature and exposure time (i.e., 130-230 degrees C, 2-5 min). Biochemical methane potential was assessed corresponding to the maximum solubilization rate; specific methane yield was obtained as 325.76 mL/g/VS. The total net energy gain of 3288.576 J/g/VS was obtained. The performance parameters were calculated by using different kinetic models. It followed the trend as modified Gompertz > transference function > logistic function models.

Torrefaction at low temperature as a promising pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass in anaerobic digestion,"The lignocellulosic structure of agricultural biomass, which makes it resistant to microbial attack, is the main obstacle in its anaerobic digestion. However, not all biomasses behave the same in the face of anaerobic digestion. Instead, depending on their composition in terms of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose content, the anaerobic digestion process may be more or less favoured, although a pretreatment stage is usually necessary. This paper presents the results of a laboratory scale batch experiment to study the effect of thermal pretreatment (torrefaction) on the anaerobic digestion of two biomass materials: barley straw and vine shoot. For this, thermal pretreatment temperatures of 100, 130, 180 and 210 degrees C, with a residence time of 24 h, were studied for both biomasses and the results were compared with the material without pretreatment. Significant differences in biogas production were observed for both biomasses depending on the pretreatment temperature. The highest biogas yields of 458 and 213 mL/gVS for straw and vine shoot, respectively, were observed from biomass pretreated at 100 degrees C. Barley straw pretreated at 100 degrees C showed 275% higher methane yield compared to untreated straw. In the case of the vine shoot, the increase was 210%. Furthermore, FTIR-ATR analysis and thermogravimetric analysis coupled with a pseudocomponent kinetic model revealed changes in the lignocellulosic composition of both biomasses while SEM analysis revealed also structural changes. The modified Gompertz model fitted the production data well and predicted shorter lag time and higher biogas production at pretreatment temperatures from 100 to 180 degrees C compared with the untreated materials. From there, a reduction in methanogenic activity is observed when the pretreatment temperature increases. In general, the change in the lignocellulosic structure and the decrease in the hemicellulose content could be considered as the main reasons to improve the biogas production.","Hidalgo, D; Castro, J; Diez, D; Martin-Marroquin, JM; Gomez, M; Perez, E",Pretreatment; Lignocellulosic; Methane; VFA; Biogas,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.125822,Physical,thermal,torrefaction,lignocellulose,barley,straw,93,85.932,,,,,,

Microbial diversity in innovative mesophilic/thermophilic temperature-phased anaerobic digestion of sludge,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) is one of the few sustainable technologies that both produce energy and treat waste streams. Driven by a complex and diverse community of microbes, AD may be affected by different factors, many of which also influence the composition and activity of the microbial community. In this study, the biodiversity of microbial populations in innovative mesophilic/thermophilic temperature-phased AD of sludge was evaluated by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The increase of digestion temperature drastically affected the microbial composition and selected specialized biomass. Hydrogenotrophic Methanobacteriales and the protein fermentative bacterium Coprothermobacter spp. were identified in the thermophilic anaerobic biomass. Shannon-Weaver diversity (H') and evenness (E) indices were calculated using FISH data. Species richness was lower under thermophilic conditions compared with the values estimated in mesophilic samples, and it was flanked by similar trend of the evenness indicating that thermophilic communities may be therefore more susceptible to sudden changes and less prompt to adapting to operative variations.","Gagliano, MC; Braguglia, CM; Gallipoli, A; Gianico, A; Rossetti, S",Methanogenic archaea; Syntrophic association.; Ultrasounds pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Mesophilic/thermophilic dual stage; Waste-activated sludge; Microbial diversity; Fluorescence in situ hybridization,2015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3061-y,Physical,ultrasonic,,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Low-Temperature Pretreatment of Lignocellulosic Biomass for Enhanced Biogas Production,"Readily available lignocellulosic biomass as substrate for biogas plants is gaining popularity amongst biogas plant operators. Results of low-temperature pretreatment (light cooking) of wheat straw to remove waxes and prepare the biomass for microbial action are described. Benefits of light cooking are low thermal energy demand and low investment cost compared to conventional techniques such as steam explosion. The novelty lies in utilizing the low temperature range 25-100 degrees C for pre-soaking the biomass. Two different types of wheat straws were pretreated at varying temperatures and sizes. The results were compared with Buswell's equation for theoretical maximum biomethane yield. Compared to untreated straw, pre-soaking leads to a significantly higher methane yield. Size reduction combined with light-cooking does not affect the methane yield in the same manner as pre-soaking of the biomass.","Casaretto, R; Agdal, EBL; Cayenne, A; Chaturvedi, T; Holm-Nielsen, JB",Biogas; Biomass; Biomethane; Lignocellulosic biomass; Low-temperature pretreatment,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ceat.201900348,Physical,thermal,low,lignocellulose,wheat,straw,91,87.36,,,,,,
Long term alkaline storage and pretreatment process of cover crops for anaerobic digestion,"The aim of this work was to study an innovative alkaline process on two cover crops. CaO load of 60 g.kgTS-1 was implemented to combine the functions of storage and pretreatment. Lab-scale reactors were monitored for 180 days to assess the effect of this process on the physico-chemical properties of the biomass. From the first days, pH was not maintained in an alkaline zone and microbial fermentation activity was observed with the degradation of available carbohydrates and production of metabolites, CO2 and H2. High butyric acid accumulation was observed and mass losses of 18.1% and 9.0% of initial VS occurred for oat and rye, respectively. However, no methane potential loss was recorded in the short and long term and the crops were efficiently preserved. The pretreatment had no major impact on fiber solubilization, and no increase in BMP was obtained, which was attributed to the short duration of the alkaline conditions.","Van Vlierberghe, C; Escudie, R; Bernet, N; Frederic, S; Carrere, H",Biomethane; Biogas; Catch crops storage; Pretreatment; Silage fermentation,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.124986,Chemical,alkaline,cao,lignocellulose,oat,plant,21,21,41.4,0.7,,29,26,4.1

The Effect of Microwave Power and Heating Time Pretreatment on Biogas Production from Fresh and Dried Water hyacinth (Eichhornia Crassipes),"The objective of this research was to study the effect of microwave pretreatment of fresh and dried water hyacinth on biogas production. The variations of microwave power levels are 240; 400; 560 and 800 W. The variations of microwave heating time are 5; 7 and 9 min. The unpretreated fresh and dried water hyacinth are used as control. The result of research showed that almost all pretreated water hyacinth produced biogas were higher compare tounpretreated water hyacinth. The maximum of biogas production from fresh and dried water hyacinthwere obtained at 560 W for 7 min and 400 W for 7 min of microwave pretreatment. In this condition, pretreated fresh and dried water hyacinth resulted biogas production of 75,12 and 53,06 mL/g TS, respectively. The unpretreated fresh and dried water hyacinth produced biogas of 37,56 and 33,56 mL/g TS, respectively. The microwave pretreatment of water hyacinth improved biogas production. Microwave pretreatment had a positive impact on anaerobic biodegradability of water hyacinth.","Sumardiono, S; Budiyono; Mardiani, DT",water hyacinth; microwave pretreatment; biogas production,2015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4938354,Physical,thermal,microwave,lignocellulose,water hyacinth,plant,,,,,,,,
"Effect of thermal, acid, alkaline and alkaline-peroxide pretreatments on the biochemical methane potential and kinetics of the anaerobic digestion of wheat straw and sugarcane bagasse","The effect of thermal, acid, alkaline and alkaline-peroxide pretreatments on the methane produced by the anaerobic digestion of wheat straw (WS) and sugarcane bagasse (SCB) was studied, using whole slurry and solid fraction. All the pretreatments released formic and acetic acids and phenolic compounds, while 5-hydroxymetilfurfural (HMF) and furfural were generated only by acid pretreatment. A remarkable inhibition was found in most of the whole slurry experiments, except in thermal pretreatment which improved methane production compared to the raw materials (29% for WS and 11% for SCB). The alkaline pretreatment increased biodegradability (around 30%) and methane production rate of the solid fraction of both pretreated substrates.

Liquefaction of pineapple peel: Pretreatment and process optimization,"This study explored the optimization of pretreatment of pineapple peel for biogas generation. Pre-treatments were carried out sulfuric acid and alkaline hydrogen peroxide prior to anaerobic digestion while the response surface methodology (RSM) was used for optimization of the pretreatment procedures. The physical, chemical, proximate and structural compositions of the peels were determined prior to and at the end of the pretreatment procedures. The dynamics of microorganisms in the reactors were also evaluated by rapid molecular methods while the Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy was employed in the identification of the chemical changes as a result of pretreatments. The use of H2O2 pretreatment caused enormous lignin solubilization in the pineapple peel. In comparison, biogas production was 67% more in the alkaline pretreated pineapple peel than the biomass treated with acid and also 51% over the untreated samples. The total biogas volume produced from the acidic pretreated, alkaline pretreated, not sifted untreated and sifted untreated samples are 194.2 +/- 3.0, 587.5 +/- 5.2, 287.8 +/- 2.1 and 245.4 +/- 3.1 respectively. Thus, the alkaline pretreated experiment used lower retention time to achieve maximum gas production in this study. The use of alkaline H2O2 on lignocelluloses has remained unpopular prior to this study. However, its usage in this study yielded better result than all the conventional treatments in terms of lignin solubilization and improvement in methane yield. Economically, the use of H2O2 for pretreatment is adjudged feasible because the 1504 kWh t(-1) TS thermal energy gain obtained from the biogas produced by the alkaline treated peel exceeded the 921 kWh t(-1) TS used in the pretreatment. This gives a net thermal energy of 583 kWh t(-1) TS. Whereas, the investment into acidic pretreatment of pineapple peel may not be economically justified because the total thermal energy gain of -200 kWh t(-1) TS was far lower than the 1236 kWh t(-1) TS thermal energy that was consumed during the pretreatment giving a net thermal energy of -1436 kWh t(-1) TS. Therefore, the use of mild alkaline pretreatment is advocated in biogas generation from pineapple peel and also for biofertilizer production mostly in localities of mass production.

Fungal pretreatment of non-sterile maize silage and solid digestate with a Cephalotrichum stemonitis strain selected from agricultural biogas plants to enhance anaerobic digestion,"The enhancement of the yields of the anaerobic digestion process was the primary target of the present study, thanks to the development of an innovative fungal pretreatment. The fungal community of agrozootechnical biogas plant feedstocks and by-products (i.e., maize silage and stover, zootechnical slurry and manure, wheat and rice straw, and solid digestate) were studied, isolating and identifying 172 strains belonging to 89 taxa. The mycobiota was dependent on the biomass: maize and zootechnical samples showed a higher biodiversity than straw and solid digestate. During the preliminary screening, Cephalotrichum stemonitis extensively grew on both non-sterile maize silage and solid digestate and it was then selected for their pretreatment. The fungus did change the biomasses features: the total solids decreased (approximately 20%), while the volatile solids slightly changed (<1%). Lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose degradation rate in maize silage was higher (55.2%, 25.0% and 24.5%, respectively) than in solid digestate (8.7%, 0.6% and 10.9%, respectively), highlighting their different accessibility and recalcitrance. During the anaerobic digestion, fungal-pretreated maize silage produced lower cumulative biogas and methane than the control, probably due to an excessive degradation of easily accessible fibers. On the contrary, the pretreated solid digestate was less recalcitrant to the microbial transformation in the anaerobic digestion: as a result, cumulative biogas and methane yields were significantly enhanced (approximately 70%). By favoring the (re)use of digestate as a feedstock, the investigated fungal pretreatment could help the economic and environmental sustainability of the anaerobic digestion.","Zanellati, A; Spina, F; Poli, A; Rolle, L; Varese, GC; Dinuccio, E",Biogas; Methane; Digestate; Fungal pretreatment; Lignocellulose,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.105934,Biological,fungi,Cephalotrichum stemonitis,lignocellulose,corn,sillage,,,,,,,,

Digestion of the pretreated materials at these conditions yielded 493 N ml/g VS methane which was 107% more than the untreated materials. In addition, the initial digestion rate was improved by 132% compared to the untreated samples.

"Bioethanol, biohydrogen and biogas production from wheat straw in a biorefinery concept","The production of bioethanol, biohydrogen and biogas from wheat straw was investigated within a biorefinery framework. Initially, wheat straw was hydrothermally liberated to a cellulose rich fiber fraction and a hemicellulose rich liquid fraction (hydrolysate). Enzymatic hydrolysis and subsequent fermentation of cellulose yielded 0.41 g-ethanol/g-glucose, while dark fermentation of hydrolysate produced 178.0 ml-H-2/g-sugars. The effluents from both bioethanol and biohydrogen processes were further used to produce methane with the yields of 0.324 and 0.381 m(3)/kg volatile solids (VS)added, respectively. Additionally, evaluation of six different wheat straw-to-biofuel production scenaria showed that either use of wheat straw for biogas production or multi-fuel production were the energetically most efficient processes compared to production of mono-fuel such as bioethanol when fermenting C6 sugars alone. Thus, multiple biofuels production from wheat straw can increase the efficiency for material and energy and can presumably be more economical process for biomass utilization. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The physicochemical, elemental and structural analyses were carried out on the biomass before and after pretreatment. The microbial composition of the fermenting materials were also determined using standard method while the Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to quantify the structural changes that took place after pretreatments. Results showed enormous reduction of hemicellulose and partial solubilization of cellulose with the application of H2SO4 for pretreatment with obvious breakdown of all important bonds in the biomass. The most suitable condition for the most efficient acidic pretreatment of the Sorghum bicolor stalk was using H2SO4 concentration of 0.75% (v.v(-1)), autoclave temperature of 118 degrees C and biomass dry mass of 3.7 g for 52 min. However, the use of H2O2 caused huge solubilization of lignin while partial dissolution of hemicellulose took place. The most suitable condition that gave the best result in this pretreatment procedure was H2O2 concentration of 6.8% (v.v(-1)), shaker temperature of 28 degrees C, agitation at 126 rpm and 3 g of biomass for 85 min. Overall, the use of the H2O2 showed reduction of lignin and hemicellulose by 73 and 42% respectively while also increasing the concentration of cellulose by 23%. The acid and alkaline pretreated biomass produced a total of 312.3 and 607.1 LNbiogas.kg VSad(-1) respectively. In comparison, the biomass pretreated with H2O2 produced 65% more LNbiogas.kg VSad(-1) than the other and equally reduced the production time by 5 days. For the alkaline treated biomass, the 1422 kWh t(-1) TS thermal energy gain exceeded the 945 kWh t(-1) TS used in the pretreatment thus giving a net thermal energy of 477 kWh t(-1) TS. However, the acidic pretreatment of Sorghum bicolor stalk is not profitable because the -131 kWh t(-1) TS thermal energy gain was far below the 1025 kWh t(-1) TS thermal energy used in pretreatment with a net thermal energy of -761 kWh t(-1) TS. Till now, use of low-cost H2O2 for biomass pretreatment is unpopular while the uses of other strong alkali and acids are well studies. However, hydrogen peroxide gave better product yield. Therefore, use of this alkali pose a novel biotechnological means for generating biogas. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Cleaner energy through liquefaction of Cocoa (Theobroma cacao) pod husk: Pretreatment and process optimization,"This study explored the production of biogas from the mono-fermentation of pretreated Cocoa pod husk. The pretreatment was carried out with sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and alkaline hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) prepared by adjusting the pH of H2O2 to 11.5 by the addition of 5 M NaOH solution. Prior to and after the pretreatments, physicochemical, structural and microbial analyses were carried on the husk using a standard method in each case. In order to determine the changes to the biomass structures after pretreatments, the Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy were used. Average total biogas volume from all the experiments i.e. the acidic pretreated (AcP), alkaline pretreated (AlP), not sifted untreated (NsU) and sifted untreated (SU) was 162.8 +/- 5.0, 564.8 +/- 5.1, 243.3 +/- 4.1 and 220.8 +/- 3.3 respectively. This shows that the AlP Cocoa pod husk yielded the highest biogas volume and was followed by the NsU and the SU husk while the lowest was obtained from the AcP biomass. Overall, the AlP biomass produced 71% more total biogas than the AcP one and also produced 57% more biogas than the NsU Cocoa pod husk. The AlP Cocoa pod husk did not only produce the highest biogas volume but also achieved peak of production faster than all the other experimental setups. Total biogas generation was achieved in just 12 days out of the 30-day retention period used in the study in which biogas production started on the 3rd day and climaxed on the 15th experimental day whereas, biogas generation did not commence until after the 5th and 6th days in other experiments and climax was not reached until between the 18th and 21st days. The result of this study has revealed that use of the low cost mild alkali is more efficient in lignin (L) solubilization and subsequent biogas yield improvement. Also, Cocoa pod husk has been shown in this study to be a profound biofuel substrate. Therefore, further use of AlP Cocoa pod husk for biogas and biofertilizer production is hereby advocated especially in major Cocoa producing regions of the world. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessing the stability of anaerobic co-digestion in the context of a WWTP with thermal pre-treatment of sewage sludge. Case study in Chile,"In this study, beverage wastewater (BW) and extended aeration sewage sludge were assessed as cosubstrates with both mixed sludge and thermally hydrolyzed sludge as substrates in an anaerobic codigestion (AcoD) process. The methodology is an integrated methodology that comprises a batch test (BMP) and semicontinuous reactor along with microbial diversity analysis. The results showed that in batch conditions, neither significant synergistic nor antagonistic effects were observed on the maximum potential (P) due to the cosubstrates presence. However, synergistic effects on a kinetic parameter (R-m) were observed when BW was used as cosubstrate. Process instability was observed in semi-continuous mode with cosubstrate BW, which was not predicted by the BMP test. As demonstrated in this study, the BMP approach is also not suitable for predicting continuous performance in real systems; however, it can be used to screen an array of substrates. In semi-continuous mode, one can expect to reach values between 50 and 60% of the biogas potential and 20-40% of the maximum production rate achieved in batch tests. The agreement between batch and semi-continuous results is also dependent on the type of inoculum used. The microbial diversity of the system was more influenced by the reactor stability than the presence of cosubstrates. To predict the performance (and stability) of real anaerobic digesters, dynamic models should be employed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

High-Temperature Microwave NaOH Pretreatment of Waste-Activated Sludge for Anaerobic Digestion,"The research reported in this paper determined the effect of combined microwave irradiation and NaOH pretreatment on solubilization and biodegradation in anaerobic digestion of waste-activated sludge (WAS). Solubilization increased significantly with NaOH concentration (20-60 meqNaOH/L) and microwave final temperature (100-170 degrees C). However, the experimental trials did not adequately approximate the response surface for volatile solids reduction, cumulative biogas production, and biogas yield. Within the design boundaries, the maximum solubilization degree (72%) of WAS occurred at 60 meq/L and 170 degrees C. The highest volatile solids removal efficiency (62.4%) was achieved at 40 meq/L and 170 degrees C. Cumulative biogas production and yield were 2.3-5.7 L/L and 154-393 mL/g added volatile solids, respectively, and both parameters were highest at 20 meq/L and 135 degrees C.

Effect of Assisted Ultrasonication and Ozone Pretreatments on Sludge Characteristics and Yield of Biogas Production,"The effects of ultrasonic and ozonation pretreatments on organic solubilization, anaerobic biodegradability, and biogas production were elucidated in this study. Two pretreatment methods for batch anaerobic digestion for biogas recovery with the same material and experimental conditions were the focus for comparison. Anaerobic digestion experiments were conducted at ambient temperature with the solid retention time set to 25 days. The obtained results indicated that the soluble chemical oxygen demand increased from 0.344 without pretreatment to 1.023 and 1.228 g/L with ultrasound and ozone pretreatments, respectively, whereas the yields of biogas production in the 25 days increased by 32.3 and 52.9% via ultrasonic irradiation and ozonation relative to the control case, respectively. The biodegradability of the organic compounds of the samples for the cases of ultrasound, ozone pretreatments, and control achieved 55.9, 64.31, and 39.18%, respectively, in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies.

Cleaner energy for cleaner production: Modeling and optimization of biogas generation from Carica papayas (Pawpaw) fruit peels,"In this study, the potentials of pretreated and untreated Carica papayas fruit peels for biogas generation was evaluated alongside its process optimization after employing the combination of mechanical and thermo-alkaline pretreatment methods. The peel was anaerobically digested using a consortium of microorganisms from cattle rumen content as inoculum. A batch system designed by the Central Composite Design (CCD) was employed. The physicochemical and microbial characteristics of the substrates and inoculum as well as the constituent of the generated biogas were evaluated using standard methods and results showed elevated levels of most elements after anaerobic digestion. The most feasible experimental biogas yields were 0.1839 m(3)/kg VS and 0.1361 m3/kg VS for the pretreated and untreated experiments respectively. Microbiologically, members of the genus Clostridium dominated the microbial flora and their succession patterns were affected by temperature and pH. The methane and carbon dioxide content of biogas from both experiments were 61.5 +/- 2.5%; 24 +/- 1% and 52 +/- 2%; 25 +/- 1.5% respectively.

Based on the optimized values, the predicted biogas yield for RSM was 0.1895 m(3)/kg VS and 0.1839 m(3)/kg VS for ANNs in the pretreated experiment. For the experiment without pretreatment, the RSM predicted yield was 0.1361 m(3)/kg VS while that of ANNs was 0.1392 m(3)/kg VS.

Evaluation of biogas production from different biomass wastes with/without hydrothermal pretreatment,"Municipal biomass waste is regarded as new available energy source, although it could cause serious environmental pollution. Generally, biogas recovery by anaerobic digestion was seen as an ideal way to treat biomass waste. Different types of biomass waste have different biogas production potential. In this paper, cow manure, pig manure, municipal sewage sludge, fruit/vegetable waste, and food waste were chosen as typical municipal biomass waste. In addition, hydrothermal pretreatment was used to accelerate digestion and increase biogas production. Biochemical methane potential (BMP) test was used to evaluate biogas production for raw biomass and hydrothermal treated waste. Raw materials of fruit/vegetable and food waste show higher methane production than that of cow manure, pig manure, and municipal sewage sludge. After hydrothermal pretreatment at typical condition (170 degrees C at 1 h), the biogas production of pig manure, cow manure, fruit/vegetable waste, and municipal sewage sludge increased by 7.8, 13.3, 18.5, and 67.8% respectively.

Effect of sulfuric acid pretreatment on biogas production from Salvinia molesta,"The effect of sulfuric acid pretreatment on biogas yield from Salvinia molesta (SM) was studied. The sulfuric acid concentration was varied to be 2, 4, 6% v/v. Pretreatment was carried out under batch system at room temperature and pressure of 1 atm for two days. Then, the digestion was carried out for 30 days under batch system at room temperature and pressure of 1 atm. The pretreatment decreased the lignin content and increased the nitrogen free extract content (non-fiber carbohydrate). The more the sulfuric acid concentration, the more the change of these contents. Furthermore, cumulative biogas yield from pretreated SM using sulfuric acid 2-6% (22.72-24.14 mL/g VS) was higher than that from raw SM (13.28 mL/g VS). For digestion during 30 days, the best pretreatment was 4% because it produced the highest total biogas yield (24.14 mL/g VS) and had very short lag time (0 day). The measured data was simulated using the modified Gompertz and first order kinetic model. The calculation showed that the modified Gompertz model (error 6.141-12.431%) was better than the first order kinetic model (error 7.336-47.606%).","Syaichurrozi, I; Villta, PK; Nabilah, N; Rusdi, R",Biogas; Pretreatment; Salvinia molesta; Sulfuric acid,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2018.102857,Chemical,acidic,h2so4,lignocellulose,salvinia,plant,,,,,,30,10,14
Optimization of methane yield by using straw briquettes- influence of additives and mold size,"A combination of briquetting wheat straw (BWS) and additives is presented in this work.

Secondly, two combinations from the first experiment were used in continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR) in co-digestion with cattle manure (CM). In this second experiment, CH4 yield, reactor performance and residual CH4 production were measured. The addition of alkali to BWS had a more significant effect on k than on the CH4 promotion. The CSTR results showed that the addition of 3% KOH to BWS had a positive effect on VS degradation, CH4 production and energy and economic balances.

Sustainable bioconversion of potato peel wastes into ethanol and biogas using organosolv pretreatment,"Potato processing industries generate considerable amounts of residues, i.e., potato peel wastes (PPW). Valorization of PPW for bioethanol and biogas production via a biorefining process was investigated in this study. Organosolv pretreatment was performed on the PPW using 50-75% (v/v) ethanol solution at 120-180 degrees C with/ without the presence of 1% (w/w) H2SO4 (as a catalyst). After the pretreatment, the solvent, i.e., ethanol, was recovered by distillation. Catalyzed organosolv pretreatment using 50% (v/v) ethanol at 120 degrees C followed by enzymatic hydrolysis resulted in a high hydrolysate yield of 539.8 g glucose/kg dry PPW that was successfully fermented to 224.2 g ethanol/kg dry PPW. To recover more energy, the liquid fraction of the pretreatment remained after solvent recovery and the unhydrolyzed solids that remained from the enzymatic hydrolysis were anaerobically digested. From each kg of dry PPW, the anaerobic digestion produced 57.9 L biomethane. Thus, the biorefinery comprising ethanolic organosolv pretreatment, solvent recovery, enzymatic hydrolysis, ethanolic fermentation, and anaerobic digestion of residues was produced 8112 kJ energy per kg of dry PPW.","Soltaninejad, A; Jazini, M; Karimi, K",Bioethanol; Biogas; Biofuel; Organosolv pretreatment; Food wastes,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.133003,Chemical,solvent,organosolv,food waste,potato peel,,,,,,,,,
Effect of two-step thermo-disintegration on the enhancing solubilization and anaerobic biodegradability of excess waste sludge,"The effectiveness of the pretreatment with a novel two-step thermo-solubilization system (TSTS-sys) on the disintegration of excess waste sludge (EWS), as well as the biogas (CH4) production efficiency of the following anaerobic mesophilic digestion, was experimentally evaluated. Carbohydrate was solubilized higher than proteins, and the concentration of VFAs increased also after pretreatment with TSTS-sys. CH4 was produced in the rate of 322 mL CH4 g(-1) VSfeed from the pre-treated EWS at 180 degrees C for 60 min operation. The CH4 composition ratios in the produced biogas were averaging 55.3 +/- 076, 62.8 +/- 097 and 71.2 +/- 1.03% for control 1, 2 and the second step of TSTS-sys, respectively. The CH4 production rate of pre-treated EWS with the two step thermal solubilization of TSTS-sys was enhanced by 63.9% and 19.5% higher compared to the control 1 and 2, respectively. The additionally enhanced biogas production rate was still insufficient to cover the energy balance deficit caused by the pre-treatment. In this study, two-step thermal solubilization of TSTS-sys showed to be an efficient feasible pretreatment for enhancing the disintegration of EWS. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Environmental impacts of biogas production from grass: Role of co-digestion and pretreatment at harvesting time,"Biogas production from anaerobic digestion of grass was evaluated in this study taking into account two harvesting machines, a Disc-mower and an Excoriator, under diverse operating conditions. In addition, the application of generated biogas either in a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant for thermal and electrical energy production or as transportation fuel after upgrading (BGU) process was evaluated. Consequential Life Cycle Assessment (CLCA) with long term marginal data was employed. Lab-scale data as well as those obtained from the ecoinvent database were used to compile life cycle inventory data. The system boundary of the present study covered harvesting operation of grass, baling, transportation of bales, anaerobic digestion, use of digestate on farmlands, and downstream processes for biogas usage. Additionally, the system boundary was expanded to take into account the effect of substituting grass with straw in animal feeds. The results demonstrated that the environmental performance of grass-based biogas plants were highly dependent on selected downstream strategies. Furthermore, it was evident that mono-digestion of grass would not guarantee a long-term sustainable renewable energy system. Based on the results obtained, Excoriator at driving speed of 7.5 km/ha had the best environmental performance in all damage categories, i.e., Human health, Ecosystem quality, Climate change, and Resources. CHP had a greater environmental performance than water scrubbing BGU for the downstream strategies taken into account. The results from the sensitivity analysis proved that a specific methane yield lower than 329 mLCH(4)/gVS cannot ensure the achievement of an eco-friendly energy system from grass-based biogas plants.","Tsapekos, P; Khoshnevisan, B; Alvarado-Morales, M; Symeonidis, A; Kougias, PG; Angelidaki, I",Grass; Mechanical pretreatment; LCA; Biogas; Bio-methane,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113467,Physical,mechanical desintegration,"excoriator,disc-mower",lignocellulose,meadow,grass,21.6,19.872,42.4,1.1,38.5454545454545,31,17,9
Photo-catalytic pretreatment of biomass for anaerobic digestion using visible light and Nickle oxide (NiOx) nanoparticles prepared by sol gel method,"The biodegradability of lignocellulosic biomass in anaerobic digesters is the key factor that limits the biogas production. Therefore, scientists are finding the possible ways to reduce the recalcitrant lignin content of biomass that greatly hinder the digestion process. The Photo-oxidation considered advanced oxidation of organic polymers in the presence of optically active catalyst preferably metal oxide. Hence, the present study was designed to report the effects of NiOx along with visible light (350-780 nm) to oxidize the highly lignified wheat straw (WS). Specifically, the experiment was designed to pretreat WS with four different NiOx concentrations under three different exposure times. Consequently, the differentially pretreated samples were subjected to biochemical methane potentials (BMPs) and continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTRs). Further, the pretreatment with 3 wt% NiOx at 4 h light exposure showed 40% (p < 0.05) increase in methane yield during BMP assays and 30% in CSTRs. In addition, the products of lignin oxidation were also quantified as vanillic acid and benzoic were found to be markedly higher (2.6 +/- 0.0 mg/gVS and 0.92 +/- 0.06 mg/gVS respectively) in the maximum pretreated sample that produced. Moreover, the pretreatment with visible light using NiOx nanoparticles was confirmed and it was concluded that light or NiOx alone posed no significant pretreatment of WS. Moreover, the products of lignin oxidation did not halt the efficacy of BMP assays as well as CSTRs. For economical balance the substrate breakpoint was estimated to be 4.53 g per treatment for positive efficacy of the process. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Effect of particle size reduction and ensiling fermentation on biogas formation and silage quality of wheat straw,"The effect of ensiling fermentation and mechanical pretreatment on the methane yield of lignocellulosic biomass was investigated in order to determine the optimum pretreatment conditions for biogas production. Wheat straw was treated using the following techniques: mechanical disintegration by chopping and extruder-grinding to particle sizes of 2.0 and 0.2 cm, respectively, and ensiling by 30% and 45% total solids with addition of enzymatic, chemical and biological silage additives individually and in combination. The total and volatile solid content, biochemical methane potential and products of silage fermentation of 32 variants were tested.

Effect of particle size reduction and ensiling fermentation on biogas formation and silage quality of wheat straw,"The effect of ensiling fermentation and mechanical pretreatment on the methane yield of lignocellulosic biomass was investigated in order to determine the optimum pretreatment conditions for biogas production. Wheat straw was treated using the following techniques: mechanical disintegration by chopping and extruder-grinding to particle sizes of 2.0 and 0.2 cm, respectively, and ensiling by 30% and 45% total solids with addition of enzymatic, chemical and biological silage additives individually and in combination. The total and volatile solid content, biochemical methane potential and products of silage fermentation of 32 variants were tested. The results indicate that the methane potential increased by 26% (from 179 to 244 mL CH4 g(-1) VS) by reducing particle size.

Ultrasound pretreatment of filamentous algal biomass for enhanced biogas production,"The filamentous alga Hydrodictyon reticulatum harvested from a bench-scale wastewater treatment pond was used to evaluate biogas production after ultrasound pretreatment. The effects of ultrasound pretreatment at a range of 10-5000 J/mL were tested with harvested H. reticulatum. Cell disruption by ultrasound was successful and showed a higher degree of disintegration at a higher applied energy. The range of 10-5000 J/mL ultrasound was able to disintegrated H. reticulatum and the soluble COD was increased from 250 mg/L to 1000 mg/L at 2500 J/mL. The disintegrated algal biomass was digested for biogas production in batch experiments. Both cumulative gas generation and volatile solids reduction data were obtained during the digestion. Cell disintegration due to ultrasound pretreatment increased the specific biogas production and degradation rates. Using the ultrasound approach, the specific methane production at a dose of 40 J/mL increased up to 384 mL/g-VS fed that was 2.3 times higher than the untreated sample. For disintegrated samples, the volatile solids reduction was greater with increased energy input, and the degradation increased slightly to 67% at a dose of 50 J/mL. The results also indicate that disintegration of the algal cells is the essential step for efficient anaerobic digestion of algal biomass. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Pretreatment of wheat straw with ligninolytic fungi for increased biogas productivity,"Biogas production from the agriculture waste biomass is a sustainable approach to managing the energy demand in the future. To do so, pretreatment is needed to remove lignin from the agribiomass to make it easily digestible substrate for the fermentative organisms. The current study was carried out to screen the most effective lignin-degrading fungal culture from their natural habitat. Pretreatment with robust ligninolytic fungi could be an efficient and economical method to degrade lignin. The presence of lignin in lignocellulosic biomass is the rate-limiting factor which reduces the biogas production. So, the best fungal strains were selected based on maximal Azure B dye decolorization. The strains were actively producing lignin peroxidases and laccases and decreased 48.2% of lignin from the wheat straw (WS) within 7 days of batch incubation. The scanning electron micrograph demonstrated visible degradation only in the fungi-treated wheat straw. The ligninolytic fungal culture pretreatment of WS enhanced the biogas yield five times compared with the untreated WS sample. Notably, these fast-acting lignin-degrading fungi gave a biogas yield with a short pretreatment time and additionally reduced the lag phase during the anaerobic digestion process. These findings showed that pretreatment with natural ligninolytic fungi could be considered as a less expensive method. The treatment is also effective in increasing the digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass and suitable for biogas production.","Shah, TA; Ullah, R",Pretreatment; Ligninolytic fungi; Enzymes activities; Biogas production,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-019-02277-8,Biological,fungi,ligninolytic,lignocellulose,wheat,straw,,,,,,,,
Extrusion and enzymatic hydrolysis as pretreatments on corn cob for biogas production,"Although agricultural wastes such as corn cob could be employed as substrates for biogas production, their lignocellulosic nature entails difficulties for their use. For this reason, a pretreatment of the biomass is recommended.

Improvement of biogas production from pine wood by alkali pretreatment,"Alkaline pretreatment with NaOH was used to improve biogas production from softwood pine. The pretreatments were carried out with 8.0% w/w NaOH solution at two temperatures (0 and 100 degrees C) for different periods of time (10, 30 and 60 min). By anaerobic digestion of the treated and untreated materials to biogas, significant effects of the pretreatments on the yield of methane were clearly observed. The best improvement was achieved by the treatment at 100 degrees C for 10 min, which resulted in 181.2% improvement in the methane production yield. The treatment at 0 degrees C was also effective, in which 60 min treatment resulted in 118.6% improvement in the methane yield compared to the untreated wood. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) was used to analyze the changes in chemical structure and physical characteristics of lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose of the treated wood, which indicated a reduction of crystallinity of cellulose due to the pretreatment. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopic images revealed that disruption of the recalcitrant structure of the pine wood could be responsible for the improvement of methane yield.

Monitoring of full-scale hydrodynamic cavitation pretreatment in agricultural biogas plant,"The implementation of hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) pretreatment for enhancing the methane potential from agricultural biomasses was evaluated in a full scale agricultural biogas plant, with molasses and corn meal as a supplementary energy source. HC batch tests were run to investigate the influence on methane production, particle size and viscosity of specific energy input. 470 kJ/kgTS was chosen for the full-scale implementation. Nearly 6-months of operational data showed that the HC pretreatment maximized the specific methane production of about 10%, allowing the biogas plant to get out of the fluctuating markets of supplementary energy sources and to reduce the methane emissions. HC influenced viscosity and particle size of digestate, contributing to reduce the energy demand for mixing, heating and pumping. In the light of the obtained results the HC process appears to be an attractive and energetically promising alternative to other pretreatments for the degradation of biomasses in biogas plant.","Garuti, M; Langone, M; Fabbri, C; Piccinini, S",Biogas; Bioenergy; Pretreatments; Hydrodynamic cavitation; Process monitoring,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.09.100,Physical,pressure,hydrodynamic cavitation,codigestion,agricultural biomass,,,,,,,,,
Bioprospecting Sulfuric Acid Assisted Hydrothermal Pretreatment of Sugarcane Bagasse and Microbial Community Structure for Methane Production,"The complex chemical and structural arrangement of lignocellulosic biomass demand a pretreatment step to dismantle its coherent nature. The current study was designed to study H2SO4 impregnation before hydrothermal pretreatment (HP) of sugarcane bagasse for biogas production using response surface methodology based on defining factors: temperature (160, 180, 200 degrees C), time (5, 12, 19 min), and H2SO4 concentration (1, 2, 3% w/v). The H2SO4 impregnation had a paramount impact in combination with temperature and treatment time parameters.

Enhancement of biogas and methanization of citrus waste via biodegradation pretreatment and subsequent optimized fermentation,"In this paper, we explored pretreatment and optimization processes in a type of agricultural feedstock substrate citrus waste (CW), an important pollution source causing surface water to be polluted by excessive acidification. For the first time, we investigated the effects of biodegradation pretreatment (BP), and designed a multi-stage optimization process to increase biogas and methane production in a stepwise manner. The results showed the pH of CW can be significantly raised via biodegradation pretreatment. The most remarkable effects of reducing CW solid waste meanwhile obtaining the highest biogas production were observed using both strains Phanerochaete chrysosporium ATCC 20696 and Aspergillus niger CCTCC 206113. Further detailed investigation suggested that the increase in biogas is correlated with the relationship between the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and pH value, as well as the volume loading, as determined by our detailed, optimized fermentation process, which contains a step-by-step procedure. We identified the parameters necessary to obtain the highest biogas yield of 308.85 mL/g-VS, the highest methane yield of 176.05 mL/g-VS, and the highest methane concentration of 57%, compared to the values before optimization. These results suggest that the environmental pollution problems resulted from CW can be relieved and simultaneously high efficiency bioenergy can be obtained via biodegradation pretreatment which largely decomposes CW solid waste.

"Castor plant for biodiesel, biogas, and ethanol production with a biorefinery processing perspective","Whole parts of castor plant, as a non-edible energy crop, were used for multiple biofuels production. Extracted castor oil was used for biodiesel production by transesterification, whereas the castor plant residues, i.e., stem, seed cake, and leaves, were employed for ethanol and biogas production. Effects of operating conditions, including methanol to oil ratio, temperature, and reaction time on biodiesel production yield were investigated. The optimum biodiesel yield was 88.2%, obtained at 0.4:1 methanol to oil mass ratio at 40 degrees C for 90 min. This yield corresponded to 155 g biodiesel per kg castor plant. In addition, pretreatment using 8% w/v NaOH at 0 and 100 degrees C for 30 and 60 min was applied to improve ethanol and biogas yields. The best results for both enzymatic hydrolysis and ethanol production by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) were obtained after alkali pretreatment at 100 degrees C for 60 min for all plant residues.

Combined mechanical enzymatic pretreatment for an improved substrate conversion when fermenting biogenic resources,"Anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic fractions of biogenic resources in biogas plants performs slowly and incompletely leaving fibrous residues. Thus, this work focused on a combined mechanical and enzymatic pretreatment of maize and grass silage to achieve a partial hydrolysis of the substrates and a higher biogas yield. To get an intensive disintegration, the refiner technology was used. For subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis, several commercially available enzyme preparations were tested, and their effect on solid substrate degradation, viscosity and pumpability of the suspensions was investigated. Experiments were performed in laboratory fermenters as well as in pilot scale (1 m(3)) at a biogas plant. The most promising enzymatic pretreatments with respect to their effect on the fermentation process were tested in 20-L semicontinuously operated laboratory scale digesters. On maize silage, a dry mass (DM) reduction up to 40% with an amylase-based preparation was achieved. Equal results were obtained with a cellulase preparation on grass silage. Yet, due to the high demand of enzyme, the economical feasibility was doubtful. Laboratory semicontinuous fermentation experiments, therefore, were performed on maize silage.

Combined mechanical enzymatic pretreatment for an improved substrate conversion when fermenting biogenic resources,"Anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic fractions of biogenic resources in biogas plants performs slowly and incompletely leaving fibrous residues. Thus, this work focused on a combined mechanical and enzymatic pretreatment of maize and grass silage to achieve a partial hydrolysis of the substrates and a higher biogas yield. To get an intensive disintegration, the refiner technology was used. For subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis, several commercially available enzyme preparations were tested, and their effect on solid substrate degradation, viscosity and pumpability of the suspensions was investigated. Experiments were performed in laboratory fermenters as well as in pilot scale (1 m(3)) at a biogas plant. The most promising enzymatic pretreatments with respect to their effect on the fermentation process were tested in 20-L semicontinuously operated laboratory scale digesters. On maize silage, a dry mass (DM) reduction up to 40% with an amylase-based preparation was achieved. Equal results were obtained with a cellulase preparation on grass silage.

Influence of Modification of the Plasticizing System on the Extrusion-Cooking Process and Selected Physicochemical Properties of Rapeseed and Buckwheat Straws,"The article discusses the effect of modification of the plasticizing system of a single-screw extruder on selected physicochemical properties of rapeseed straw and buckwheat straw. A TS-45 single-screw extruder (ZMCh Metalchem, Gliwice, Poland) with an L/D = 12 plasticizing system was used for the process. The shredded straws were moistened to four moisture levels: 20, 25, 30 and 35% dry matter. Three different rotational speeds of the extruder screw were applied for the test cycle: 70, 90 and 110 rpm. The following characteristics were determined for the extrusion-cooking process: efficiency and specific mechanical energy. Selected physical properties were determined for the extrudates obtained in the process: water absorption index (WAI), water solubility index (WSI), bulk density, and the efficiency of cumulative biogas and cumulative methane production expressed on dry mass, fresh mass, and fresh organic mass basis. It has been proved that the modification of the plasticizing system had a significant impact on the course of the process and the tested physicochemical properties. An important factor confirming the correctness of the modification is the increase in biogas efficiency. After modification, the highest yield of cumulative biogas from the fresh mass was 12.94% higher than in the sample processed before modification.","Kupryaniuk, K; Oniszczuk, T; Combrzynski, M; Lisiecka, K; Janczak, D",thermomechanical pretreatment; biogas; methane; biomass; lignocellulose materials,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma15145039,Physical,mechanical desintegration,screw extruder,lignocellulose,rapeseed,straw,,,,,,,,

Microbial pretreatment of water hyacinth for enhanced hydrolysis followed by biogas production,"Biological pretreatment with novel isolated microbial pure culture was utilised to pretreat water hyacinth to enhance its solubilisation followed by biogas production. Lignocellulose degrading bacterial strains isolated from soil (Bordetella muralis VKVVG5) (UN3d2), the gut of silverfish (Citrobacter werkmanii VKVVG4) (SFa2) and millipede (Paenibacillus sp. VKVVGI) (BrB2) were employed to optimise the ideal bacterial strain illustrating accelerated hydrolysis of water hyacinth. Citrobacter werkmanii VKVVG4 pretreatment of water hyacinth with an optimum dosage of 10(9) CFU/mL and time of 4 days helped in achieving the highest solubilisation of 33.3%. Biochemical methane potential (BMP) test was conducted between untreated and Citrobacter werkmanii VKVVG4 pretreated water hyacinth. Biochemical methane potential (BMP) test of pretreated water hyacinth illustrated faster start up period than the untreated water hyacinth. Citrobacter werkmanii VKVVG4 (SFa2) pretreated water hyacinth illustrated a cumulative biogas production of 3737 +/- 21 mL whereas untreated water hyacinth illustrated a cumulative biogas production of 3038 +/- 13 mL on the 50th day. Scaled up batch (20 L) study demonstrated a three times increase in the cumulative biogas generation of the microbial pretreated water hyacinth than the untreated water hyacinth.

Biorefining for olive wastes management and efficient bioenergy production,"The potential of olive wastes for development of a multi-product biorefinery was investigated. Different parts of olive wastes, i.e., stone, pomace, leaves, and wood, were subjected to liquid hot water, organosolv, and acid catalyzed organosolv (ACO) pretreatments prior to bioconversion through three different scenarios. The first scenario, i.e., anaerobic digestion of substrates for biogas production, yielded 219.3 m(3) biomethane per hectare of olive trees, equated to 247.4 L gasoline.

Development of sustainable approaches for converting the agro-weedsLudwigia hyssopifoliato biogas production,"This study aimed to evaluate potential biogas production fromLudwigia hyssopifolia(water primrose) and examine the effect of alkaline pretreatment on samples through biogas production efficiencies. The research was carried out for 45 days of operation from anaerobic mono-digestion of water primrose by using a batch experiment. Pretreatment was applied for substrate using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution (w/v) at different concentrations (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4%) with 10% of total solids (TS) based on dry matter. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were captured to investigate the characteristics of the raw material and pretreated biomass. The results showed that the treatment with 2% NaOH has the highest performance in biogas yield (8072.00 mL) and methane content (64.72%). Notably, the increase (3, 4%) or decreasing (0, 1%) NaOH concentration in treating water primrose did not achieve a significant improvement. Further investigation in the power potential of produced biogas was calculated, and the result was 22,382.19 W/m(3)power. Consequently, the feasibility of the alkaline pretreatment method for biogas production and achievable potential for energy efficiency indicates that water primrose is appropriate agro-weed biomass for bioenergy applications.","Nong, HTT; Whangchai, K; Unpaprom, Y; Thararux, C; Ramaraj, R",Water primrose; Pretreatment; Mono-digestion; Biogas production,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13399-020-01083-4,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,lignocellulose,Ludwigia hyssopifolia,plant,,,,,,,,
Enhancement of Ethanol and Biogas Production From High-Crystalline Cellulose by Different Modes of NMO Pretreatment,"Pretreatment of high-crystalline cellulose with N-methyl-morpholine-N-oxide (NMO or NMMO) to improve bioethanol and biogas production was investigated. The pretreatments were performed at 90 and 120 degrees C for 0.5-15 h in three different modes, including dissolution (85% NMO), ballooning (79% NMO) and swelling (73% NMO). The pretreated materials were then enzymatically hydrolyzed and fermented to ethanol or anaerobically digested to biogas (methane). The pretreatment at 85% NMO, 120 degrees C and 2.5 h resulted in 100% yield in the Subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis and around 150% improvement in the yield of ethanol compared to the untreated and water-treated material. However, the best results of biogas production were obtained when the cellulose was treated with swelling and ballooning mode, which gave almost complete digestion in 15 days. Thus, the Pretreatment resulted in 460 g ethanol or 415 L methane from each kg of cellulose. Analysis of the structure of treated and untreated celluloses showed that the dissolution mode can efficiently convert the crystalline Cellulose I to Cellulose II. However, it decreases the water swelling capacity of the cellulose. On the other hand, swelling. and ballooning modes in NMO treatment were less efficient in both water swelling capacity and cellulose crystallinity. No cellulose loss, ambient pressure, relatively moderate conditions, and high efficiency make the NMO a good alternative for pretreatment of high-crystalline cellulosic materials. Biotechnol.

Two-steps Utilization of Shorea Wood Waste Biomass for The Production of Oyster Mushroom and Biogas - A zero waste approach,"Two-steps utilization of residual Shorea wood biomass (Meranti) from saw mill industry in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan, Indonesia was studied to point out its potential as the feedstock for the production of food and energy. For this purposes, oyster mushroom, Pleurotus ostreatus was cultivated on mixed sawdust of Shorea wood (major species; Shorea leprosula), and then the residual wood obtained from mushroom production (spent waste) was subjected to methane fermentation by mixing with cow dung in two steps utilization process. The effects of the bio treatment on biogas production and correlation with compositional changes in the wood by mushroom cultivation were evaluated. P. ostreatus preferentially decomposed lignin in the tropical wood with high productivity of matured fruiting body. During 44 days, fruiting bodies were harvested and collected four times, and lignin and holocellulose in the Shorea wood decreased by 24.7% and 15.8%, respectively. Biological activity expressed as yields of the fruiting body was the maximum at the first flush, and decreased gradually. In methane fermentation, addition of pretreated wood waste increased production of biogas by 2-3 times higher than those without the bio-treated wood. The combination of mushroom and biogas production of residual Shorea wood biomass creates a new industrial application of unutilized wood biomass from tropical rainforests, with a great deal of advantages supplying value-added foodstuff and also renewable energy for the local community.

Ultrasonic pretreatment and subsequent anaerobic digestion under different operational conditions,"In this study ultrasonic pretreatment was investigated in order to improve anaerobic digestion. First, the most effective sonication time was selected during the preliminary studies conducted on waste activated sludge samples. Then the optimal time selected was confirmed running batch anaerobic reactors. In the last part of the experiments, the effect of sonication was investigated for different operational conditions of semi-continuous digesters. Preliminary studies showed 15 min of sonication increased 50 mg/L initial soluble COD concentration up to a value of 2500 mg/L. Batch anaerobic digester results indicated that the increased soluble substrate improved anaerobic biodegradability concurrently, again with the maximal improvement observed for 15 min of sonication. Results from semi-continuous reactors indicated that at SRT of 15 days and OLR of 0.5 kg/m(3) d, ultrasonic pretreatment improved the daily biogas production, methane production and volatile solids reduction significantly when compared to control system. During the operation of reactors at 7.5 days of SRT, pretreatment helped to keep the reactors working. A simple economical analysis of the system was performed using the data obtained during the laboratory study. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Enzymatic and organic acid pretreatment of seaweed: effect on reducing sugars production and on biogas inhibition,"Seaweeds are a valuable feedstock in the production of biofuels such as biogas. In order to achieve higher conversion rates, the biomass requires a pretreatment step. However, the use of harsh conditions is detrimental to the environment and negatively affects the biochemical composition of the seaweed, lowering the yields of the products. In this study, Laminaria digitata and Saccharina latissima were pretreated with organic acids and enzymes. The extent of hydrolysis was evaluated by the concentration of reducing sugars (RS) released from the seaweed. Thereafter, the effect of pretreatments on biogas production from L. digitata was investigated in 120 ml batch reactors incubated at 35 degrees C. Oxalic acid and the enzymatic preparation Cellulase (Sigma C9748) improved the recovery of RS. Pretreatments inhibited the anaerobic digestion process and only a 6% increase in biogas production was obtained when the biomass was subjected to a combination of 2.5% citric acid and Cellulase.","Vanegas, CH; Hernon, A; Bartlett, J",reducing sugars; biogas; Laminaria digitata; volatile solids; pretreatment,2015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01430750.2013.820143,Biological,enzyme,cellulass+acidic oxalic acid,algae,laminaria,,,,,,,,,

The hydrolysate of the pretreated PCR was microbially fermented to xanthan gum and ethanol through scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Moreover, the stillages (waste residues) of both scenarios were anaerobically digested to produce biomethane. The maximum glucose yield of 74.6% was achieved after the catalytic pretreatment of PCR with 50% ethanol at 180 degrees C, while the yield from the untreated PCR was only 34.8%. Xanthan gum and ethanol yield from the untreated PCR were only 6.2 g xanthan gum per 100 g substrate and 27.5%, respectively. After the pretreatment at the optimum conditions, the highest xanthan gum (12.5 g per 100 g substrate) and ethanol (56.1%) yields were obtained. Moreover, the greatest biomethane yield of 196.0 mL g(-1) volatile solids was obtained from the liquid fraction of organosolv pretreatment at 180 degrees C with 50% ethanol, in the absence of the catalyst. Overall, the highest obtained energy was 66.7 and 147.7 L gasoline equivalent per ton of PCR for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Scenario 1 provided an economic potential of $ 280.7, which was higher than that of the second scenario ($ 107.4).","Soltaninejad, A; Jazini, M; Karimi, K",Potato crop residues; Bioethanol; Biogas; Organosolv pretreatment; Biorefinery,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2022.106354,Chemical,solvent,organosolv,lignocellulose,potato,plant,,,,,,,,

Different pretreatments for increasing the anaerobic biodegradability in swine manure,"The effect of three methods (mechanical, chemical, and thermal pretreatment) were tested to improve methane production and anaerobic biodegradability of swine wastes. The first experiment was designed to determine the biodegradability enhancement through the separation of liquid and solid matrix by using a 0.25 mm pore size screen (mechanical pretreatment). The second approach was the treatment of swine waste by the addition of a flocculant agent and strong chemicals such as acid (HCl) and alkali (NaOH). The third pretreatment studied was thermal application (170 degrees C provided by vapor). The soluble COD was increased by 57% and 32% during the pretreatment period with alkali and thermal application, respectively. In addition, these two pretreatments gave the highest enhancement on methane production with regard to the untreated sample. Meanwhile, the addition of a flocculant improved the methane production of the liquid fraction but not the solid one. On the other hand, mechanical pretreatment did not show any important enhancement. Biodegradability percentage followed the same trend as methane productivity. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Methane yield improved by 143.5 and 180.2% under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, respectively. Compositional analysis of the effluent after AD showed the percentile conversion of 50.8% of cellulose, 59.5% of hemicellulose, 39.9% of acid-soluble and 21.7% of acid-insoluble lignin to methane under mesophilic conditions. Under thermophilic conditions, 57.3% of cellulose, 70.1% of hemicellulose, 39.4% of acid-soluble and 19.4% of acid-insoluble lignin were converted to methane.

Study on the Rice Straw Pretreated with NaOH for Biogasification,"In this study, Box-Behnken design (BBD) and response surface analysis (RSA) methodology were employed to plan experiments and optimize the NaOH pretreatment of rice straw. Experimental results showed that concentration of NaOH (CS), treatment time (TT) and ratio of rice straw with NaOH (RS) were main factors governing the biogasification of rice straw. The polynomial equation describing the biogasification as a simultaneous function of the CS, TT and RS was confirmed.

Empirical modeling of the effects of emerging pretreatment methods on anaerobic digestion of pulp mill biosolids,"Effects of sludge type, microwave temperature, sonication time, and anaerobic digester temperature were investigated on solubilization and methane production from pulp mill secondary and primary sludges by multi-level factorial designs. Analysis of variance showed that all main effects (microwave temperature, sludge type and digestion temperature) and two-way interactions have significant (P-value < 0.05) effects on cumulative methane production relative to control (not pretreated) digesters (CMPr) at elevated microwave temperatures (150-175 degrees C). On the other hand, at lower microwave temperatures (50, 75, and 100 degrees C), pretreatments did not significantly improve the CMPr. During the sonication, sonication time and digestion temperature significantly affected the CMPr with a P-value < 0.05. The variance analysis also determined that, for both pretreatment methods, the most important factor affecting the sludge solubilizat ion. indicated by the relative to control soluble to total chemical oxygen demand ratio (SCOD/TCODr), was the sludge type. To select a pretreatment/digestion that maximizes both the rate as well as the extent of anaerobic biodegradation, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) was applied and it was concluded that mesophilic anaerobic digestion of pulp mill secondary sludge irradiated at 125 degrees C can result in an optimal pretreatment scenario with SCOD/TCODr and CMPr of 6.1, and 1.7, respectively.

Intracellular disintegration by shockwave pretreatment accelerates dry fermentation,"Dry fermentation refers to the process of anaerobic digestion that does not take place in a mixable liquid environment but in stacks loaded into airtight chambers. Since it is difficult for anaerobic consortia to decompose biomass without operating fluid, the process of dry fermentation is time consuming and considered technically inefficient. However, the construction costs of such biogas plants are significantly lower in comparison to conventional continuous technologies. Shockwave pretreatment is a modern method of intracellular disintegration that occurs purely on the basis of physical forces. It was confirmed for the first time that shockwaves are capable of accelerating methanogenesis, even in technologies that do not utilise a process liquid. This finding opens up new opportunities with regards to the processing of feedstock such as solid biowaste.","Stehel, V; Marouskova, A; Kolar, L",Biogas; biowaste management; dry fermentation; pretreatment; process economics,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15567036.2018.1454553,Physical,pressure,shockwave,lignocellulose,corn,sillage,,24.4,,,,,,
Alkaline solubilization and microwave irradiation as a combined sludge disintegration and minimization method,"Commonly used pretreatment method of alkaline solubilization (using NaOH) and a relatively new technology of microwave (MW) irradiation (160 degrees C) were combined as a pretreatment method of waste activated sludge (WAS) in this study. First alkaline and MW pretreatment methods were examined separately, then their combination for different conditions was investigated in terms of their effect on COD solubilization, turbidity and capillary suction time (CST). For combined pretreatments, soluble COD to total COD ratio (SCOD/TCOD) of WAS increased from 0.005 (control) to 0.18, 0.27, 0.34 and 0.37 for combined methods of MW and pH-10, 11, 12 and 12.5, respectively. Deteriorated dewaterability due to alkaline pretreatment was also improved due to the incorporation of MW irradiation. Further, with small scale batch anaerobic reactors, pH-10, pH-12, MW (alone), MW+pH-10 and MW+pH-12 pretreated WAS samples were anaerobically digested. Highest total gas and methane productions were achieved with MW + pH-12 pretreatment with 16.3% and 18.9% improvements over control reactor, respectively. Finally the performance of MW+pH-12 pretreatment was examined with 2L anaerobic semi-continuous reactors for 92 days and compared to that of the control reactors. These reactors were operated at an SRT of 15 days. After steady state, 43.5% and 55% improvements were obtained in respective daily total gas and methane productions. TS, VS and TCOD reductions were improved by 24.9%, 35.4% and 30.3%, respectively based on a relative calculation with respect to control reactors. This way combined alkaline-microwave treatment proved to be an effective sludge minimization method. Pretreated digested sludge had 22% improved dewaterability than unpretreated digested sludge.

Fungal Pretreatments on Non-Sterile Solid Digestate to Enhance Methane Yield and the Sustainability of Anaerobic Digestion,"Fungi can run feedstock pretreatment to improve the hydrolysis and utilization of recalcitrant lignocellulose-rich biomass during anaerobic digestion (AD). In this study, three fungal strains (Coprinopsis cinerea MUT 6385, Cyclocybe aegerita MUT 5639, Cephalotrichum stemonitis MUT 6326) were inoculated in the non-sterile solid fraction of digestate, with the aim to further (re)use it as a feedstock for AD. The application of fungal pretreatments induced changes in the plant cell wall polymers, and different profiles were observed among strains. Significant increases (p < 0.05) in the cumulative biogas and methane yields with respect to the untreated control were observed. The most effective pretreatment was carried out for 20 days with C. stemonitis, causing the highest hemicellulose, lignin, and cellulose reduction (59.3%, 9.6%, and 8.2%, respectively); the cumulative biogas and methane production showed a 182% and 214% increase, respectively, compared to the untreated control. The increase in AD yields was ascribable both to the addition of fungal biomass, which acted as an organic feedstock, and to the lignocellulose transformation due to fungal activity during pretreatments. The developed technologies have the potential to enhance the anaerobic degradability of solid digestate and untap its biogas potential for a further digestion step, thus allowing an improvement in the environmental and economic sustainability of the AD process and the better management of its by-products.","Zanellati, A; Spina, F; Rolle, L; Varese, GC; Dinuccio, E",digestate; solid fractions (SFDs); lignocellulose; pretreatment; fungi; biogas,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12208549,Biological,fungi,"Coprinopsis cinerea MUT 6385, Cyclocybe aegerita MUT 5639, Cephalotrichum stemonitis MUT 6326",lignocellulose,digestate,solid fraction,,,,,,,,
Enhanced biogas production from sunflower stalks using hydrothermal and organosolv pretreatment,"Biomethane production through anaerobic digestion of sunflower stalks was improved by the hydrothermal and isopropanol-based organosolv pretreatments.

Autohydrolysis pretreatment of secondary sludge for anaerobic digestion,"The increase in the number of wastewater treatment plants and the quality required for the residue produced makes it necessary to improve the efficiency of anaerobic digestion of sludge. Pretreatments of secondary sludge have shown important advantages in the elimination of volatile solids and pathogenic microorganisms from the sludge, and they have also had a positive effect on biogas production. However, such methods are associated with high operating costs. This paper shows the behavior of a autohydrolysis pretreatment, which consists of subjecting the secondary sludge to a temperature of 55 degrees C for 12-24 h with a limited amount of oxygen under batch operation. The pretreatment results in a high solubilization of organic matter, increasing the fluidity of the sludge and improving the biogas production. This study focuses on the evaluation of the influence of oxygen and the initial sludge concentration on the pretreatment behavior. The main results obtained showed that when autohydrolysis pretreatment was carried out for 12 h, with a high solid concentration and microaerobic conditions, the solubilization of organic matter was increased by 40%, the methane productivity was improved by 23%, and there was an overall improvement in sludge fluidity. Moreover, the energy assessment of the autohydrolysis pretreatment and anaerobic digestion system showed the energetic feasibility of this treatment method, since the increase in energy production compensates for the extra energy required to carry out the pretreatment.

Hydrothermal and alkaline hydrothermal pretreatments plus anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge for dewatering and biogas production: Bench-scale research and pilot-scale verification,"To test the feasibility and practicability of the process combing hydrothermal pretreatment for dewatering with biogas production for full utilization of sewage sludge, hydrothermal/alkaline hydrothermal pretreatments and in turn anaerobic digestion of the filtrates obtained after dewatering the pretreated sludge were performed at bench- and pilot-scales. The hydrothermal temperature fell within the range of 140 degrees C-220 degrees C and the pretreatment time varied from 30 min to 120 min. For the alkaline hydrothermal pretreatment the pH value of the sludge was adjusted to 9.0-11.0 by adding Ca(OH)(2). The results showed that the dewaterability of the sewage sludge was improved with increasing pretreatment temperature but the impact of the pretreatment time was not significant. The addition of Ca(OH)(2) gave better performance on the subsequent mechanical dewatering of the pretreated sludge compared to pure hydrothermal pretreatment, and the higher the pH value was, the better the dewaterability of the pretreated sludge was. The conditions of 180 degrees C/30 min and 160 degrees C/60 min/pH = 10.0 (for hydrothermal and alkaline hydrothermal pretreatments, respectively) resulted in relatively good results in the theoretical energy balance, which were verified in the pilot-scale tests.

For the alkaline hydrothermal pretreatment the pH value of the sludge was adjusted to 9.0-11.0 by adding Ca(OH)(2). The results showed that the dewaterability of the sewage sludge was improved with increasing pretreatment temperature but the impact of the pretreatment time was not significant. The addition of Ca(OH)(2) gave better performance on the subsequent mechanical dewatering of the pretreated sludge compared to pure hydrothermal pretreatment, and the higher the pH value was, the better the dewaterability of the pretreated sludge was. The conditions of 180 degrees C/30 min and 160 degrees C/60 min/pH = 10.0 (for hydrothermal and alkaline hydrothermal pretreatments, respectively) resulted in relatively good results in the theoretical energy balance, which were verified in the pilot-scale tests. Based on the data from the pilot tests, the alkaline hydrothermal process realized self-sufficiency in energy at the cost of a proper amount of CaO. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Alkaline hydrogen peroxide pretreatment of energy crops for biogas production,"In this study, the influence of alkaline hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) pretreatment of the three different plant sources: Miscanthus giganteus, Sorghum Moench, and Sida hermaphrodita, for biogas production was investigated. The influence of temperature, reaction time, and H2O2 concentration on the efficiency of biomass degradation and on the further methanogenic fermentation were studied. The results obtained after chemical pretreatment indicate that using H2O2 at alkaline conditions leads to the decomposition of three major structures: lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose. The best results were achieved for the process performed at 25A degrees C for 24 h with the use of a 5 mass % H2O2 solution. Although the degradation level was very high for all three plant sources, the biogas production from the energy crops pretreated chemically was strongly inhibited by byproducts and the residual oxygen formed after H2O2 decomposition. This fact indicates that alkaline H2O2 pretreatment is a very promising method for plant material degradation for further biogas production, but pretreated biomass must be separated from supernatant before the fermentation process because of the high concentration of inhibitors in the hydrolysates. The best results were obtained for Sida with biogas and methane production of 2.29 Ndm(3) and 1.06 Ndm(3), respectively.","Michalska, K; Ledakowicz, S",hydrogen peroxide; alkaline conditions; chemical pretreatment; biogas production,2014,http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11696-013-0531-5,Chemical,alkaline,,lignocellulose,miscanthus,plant,94,90,,,,48,21,29

Anaerobic digestion of extracts from steam exploded Agave tequilana bagasse,Anaerobic digestion (AD) in the beverage industry is a proven treatment technology. But adding dissolved organic matter to AD can increase the on-site output of renewable energy. In the tequila industry such waste derived organic matter can be obtained from semisolid agave bagasse submitted to steam explosion as pretreatment. Vapor at pressure < 1.0 MPa is commonly available so that steam explosion can be integrated into extant production schemes. This study investigates the efficiency of agave bagasse hydrolyzation via steam explosion (applying severity factors between 2.4 and 3.7 with 0.98 MPa maximum pressure) as well as the efficiency of the bio-conversion in anaerobic batch assays. The best steam explosion yield was 14.3 +/- 0.1 g(COD) 100 g(-1) (0.98 MPa vapor pressure during 22 min followed by fast pressure release). The average biochemical methane potential (BMP) was 290 mL(N) g(COD)(-1) with 74% of the biogas released within seven days.,"Weber, B; Estrada-Maya, A; Sandoval-Moctezuma, AC; Martinez-Cienfuegos, IG",Thermal pretreatment; Biogas; Semisolid waste; Lignocellulosic biomass; Biorefinery,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.05.093,Physical,thermal,steam explosion,lignocellulose,Agave tequilana,bagasse,,,,,,,,
Effect of Ultrasonic Pretreatment on Biogas Production from Rice Straw,"The effect of ultrasonic pretreatment on biogas production from rice straw was investigated. Results showed that the application of 37 and 102 kHz resulted in a reduction of hemicellulose about 25.78% and 20.82%, respectively. An increase in the power level and exposition time decreased the hemicellulose content. The biochemical methane potential values at 37 kHz and 102 kHz of the pretreated rice straw for a period of 45 days were 250.36 and 243.79 mL CH4 g VSadded-1, which were about 21.95% and 18.75% increase compared to the unpretreated one, respectively. The pretreatment with 37 kHz has provided a better methane yield compared to the one with 102 kHz. Response surface methodology indicated a positive result toward the methane yield and production rate. The utilization of ultrasonic pretreatment toward rice straw for biogas production seems to provide a solution to help solving the problems of both agricultural waste and renewable energy.","Pansripong, S; Arjharn, W; Liplap, P; Hinsui, T",Pretreatment; Ultrasonic; Biogas; Rice straw; Biochemical potential assay,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.13005/ojc/350403,Physical,ultrasonic,,lignocellulose,rice,straw,,,49.5,0.5,99,,,
Effect of pretreatment solutions and conditions on decomposition and anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic biomass in rice straw,"This study assessed the effects of hot water, acid, and alkali pretreatments on the lignocellulosic composition of rice straw and methane production potential of the pretreated solids-reagent mixture. Autoclaving (121 degrees C, 1.45 atm, 60 min) after addition of 2% H2SO4 showed the highest lignocellulose decomposition efficiency of 65.4%. However, the methane production potential was even smaller than that of the untreated sample, indicating the inhibitory effect of the acid in the biogas production process. On the other hand, hot water- and alkali-pretreated samples showed a factor of 2.1 greater methane production potential than untreated sample despite the relatively lower lignocellulose decomposition efficiency of 17.0-50.4%. By simply keeping the rice straw immersed in water at 100 degrees C for 30-60 min. or autoclaving prior to anaerobic digestion, the methane production potential of 805.8-824.2 mL of CH4/g total carbon and the overall lignocellulose degradability of 73.6-84.4% was achieved.

Effect of enzymatic pretreatment on anaerobic co-digestion of sugar beet pulp silage and vinasse,"Results of sugar beet pulp silage (SBPS) and vinasse (mixed in weight ratios of 3:1, 1:1 and 1:3, respectively) co-fermentation, obtained in this study, provide evidence that addition of too high amount of vinasse into the SBPS decreases biogas yields. The highest biogas productivity (598.1 mL/g VS) was achieved at the SBPS-vinasse ratio of 3:1 (w/w). Biogas yields from separately fermented SBPS and vinasse were by 13% and 28.6% lower, respectively. It was found that enzymatic pretreatment of SBPS before methane fermentation that caused partial degradation of component polysaccharides, considerably increased biogas production. The highest biogas yield (765.5 mL/g VS) was obtained from enzymatic digests of SBPS-vinasse (3:1) blend (27.9% more than from fermentation of the counterpart blend, which was not treated with enzymes).

Efficient conversion of sweet sorghum stalks to biogas and ethanol using organosolv pretreatment,"Improvement of bioconversion of sweet sorghum stalks to ethanol and biogas by organosolv pretreatment was investigated. The pretreatments were carried out at 100-160 degrees C in the presence or absence of sulfuric acid (as a catalyst) using ethanol (as an organic solvent) for 30 min. After evaporation of the solvent (ethanol), the pretreated solids (bagasse) and the liquid fraction (liquor) were subjected to anaerobic digestion for 50 days. The greatest biomethane yield, achieved from the mixture of liquor and bagasse, was 278 ml CH4/g VS, corresponding to 92% of theoretical yield and showing 270% improvement compared to the methane yield obtained from untreated stalks. The enzymatic hydrolysis of the untreated stalk and the obtained bagasse was conducted at 45 degrees C for 96 h using 20 FPU cellulase and 50 IU beta-glucosidase per gram of the substrate. Hydrolysis of the untreated stalk resulted in a low sugar yield (34.1% of the theoretical yield). The highest sugar yield (77% of the theoretical yield) was obtained after pretreatment with 50% ethanol and 1% sulfuric acid at 140 degrees C. Accordingly, ethanol yield from the respective organosolv pretreated material showed a two-fold improvement compared to the untreated substrate. Ethanol production from liquor ended with a maximum yield of 65.7% after pretreatment with 50% ethanol at 100 degrees C in the absence of acid.

The effect of pressure and temperature pretreatment on the biogas output from algal biomass,"This paper presents data on methane fermentation of algal biomass containing Chlorella sp. and Scenedesmus sp. The biomass was obtained from closed-culture photobioreactors. Before the process, the algae were subjected to low temperature and pressure pretreatment for 0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 h. The prepared biomass was subjected to mesophilic methane fermentation. The amount and composition of the biogas formed in the process were determined. The amount of biogas produced was larger when the biomass was subjected to thermal preprocessing. The proportion of methane in the gas also increased.

The effects of temperature and duration of thermal pretreatment on the solid-state anaerobic digestion of dairy cow manure,"Cellulosic substrates such as dairy cow manure often yield low volumes of biogas and low concentrations of methane when digested anaerobically. Thermal pretreatment of dairy cow manure was investigated to determine if pretreatment temperature and duration can be optimized to maximize biogas yield and methane concentration. A central composite rotatable design was used to select combinations of temperature and duration. Based on measured data, statistical models were generated to estimate the biogas yield and methane concentration during digestion. The highest biogas yields were from the untreated samples and samples treated at the center temperature and duration of the statistical model (125 degrees C, 37.5 min). The model predicted the optimum pretreatment conditions of 140 degrees C for 30 minutes. Under the conditions of this experiment, temperature and duration had no significant effect on the biogas yield and methane concentration. This lack of significance may indicate that thermal pretreatment may be an unnecessary step in the anaerobic digestion of dairy cow manure, which could reduce capital and operating costs for the industry.","McVoitte, WPA; Clark, OG",Bioengineering; Energy; Dairy cow manure; Thermal pretreatment; Solid-state anaerobic digestion; Lignocellulose; Central composite rotatable design; Agricultural engineering; Agricultural water management; Bioenergy; Energy sustainability; Waste treatment,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02140,Physical,thermal,,manure,cow,,,,,,,,,
Evaluation of the Methane Production Potential of Catfish Processing Wastewater Using Various Anaerobic Digestion Strategies,"The U.S. catfish industry is a major industry that has been declining over the years due to imports competition and growing operational costs. Catfish processing wastewater management and high energy requirement put a large financial burden on catfish processing facilities. Recovered protein-based solids have provided some value-added co-products, however, more co-products are needed to offset processing costs. Anaerobic digestion is a proven waste treatment method that produces methane, which is an energetic co-product that can be used within the processing facilities. This study was conducted to evaluate the potential of anaerobic digestion as an alternative to the currently used aerobic biotreatment of catfish processing wastewater. Initial assessments indicated the recalcitrance of the full-strength wastewater to anaerobic digestion, yielding only similar to 4 m(3) per ton (U.S.) of input chemical oxygen demand (CODinput). Thus, several strategies were evaluated to improve the methane yield from the wastewater. These strategies include nutrient (nitrogen and sulfur) amendment, along with ozone, HCl, and NaOH pretreatment. The results showed that nutrient amendment was the most suitable strategy for improving the digestibility of the catfish processing wastewater. A methane yield of 121-236 m(3)/ton (U.S.) CODinput was obtained, with a purity of 67-80 vol.%. These results are similar to yields and purities of biogas from other feedstock, such as food waste, wastewater solids, and fish canning wastewater.

Evaluation of the Methane Production Potential of Catfish Processing Wastewater Using Various Anaerobic Digestion Strategies,"The U.S. catfish industry is a major industry that has been declining over the years due to imports competition and growing operational costs. Catfish processing wastewater management and high energy requirement put a large financial burden on catfish processing facilities. Recovered protein-based solids have provided some value-added co-products, however, more co-products are needed to offset processing costs. Anaerobic digestion is a proven waste treatment method that produces methane, which is an energetic co-product that can be used within the processing facilities. This study was conducted to evaluate the potential of anaerobic digestion as an alternative to the currently used aerobic biotreatment of catfish processing wastewater. Initial assessments indicated the recalcitrance of the full-strength wastewater to anaerobic digestion, yielding only similar to 4 m(3) per ton (U.S.) of input chemical oxygen demand (CODinput). Thus, several strategies were evaluated to improve the methane yield from the wastewater. These strategies include nutrient (nitrogen and sulfur) amendment, along with ozone, HCl, and NaOH pretreatment. The results showed that nutrient amendment was the most suitable strategy for improving the digestibility of the catfish processing wastewater.

Press-extrusion pretreatment of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste for enhanced methane production,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a well-established process for the treatment of a wide variety of solid organic substrates, including the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). At industrial scale, the mechanical pretreatment is a fundamental step to reduce OFMSW particle size and to promote the hydrolysis within the subsequent AD process. Among the mechanical pretreatment technologies, press-extrusion has recently raised great interest for its possible application to either enhance the organic load to the digester or improve the overall process stability and methane yields. Aim of this study was in assessing the potential of the press-extrusion pretreatment to improve the performance of OFMSW anaerobic degradation. Batch tests were set up according to a full factorial design of experiments to assess the significance of the main operating parameters. The statistical analysis of results addressed further tests, carried out under semi-continuous feeding mode, to better discuss the possible application of press-extrusion for the greatest valorization of OFMSW under anaerobic conditions.","Cesaro, A; Cieri, V; Belgiorno, V",Biogas; Circular economy; Energy; Pretreatment; Recovery; Solid waste,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10163-020-01105-3,Physical,mechanical desintegration,press extrusion,food waste,mixed,standard,,,,,,,,
Enhancement of paddy straw digestibility and biogas production by sodium hydroxide-microwave pretreatment,"Biogas has become a promising energy substitute to fossil fuels. Lignocellulosics, being cheap and renewable resource, could be very well used as a feedstock for biogas generation. Paddy straw is an abundant lignocellulose which is rich in organic matter like cellulose, hemi-cellulose and lignin. It is generally disposed off by burning causing environmental pollution whilst it can be used for biofuel generation. The digestibility of paddy straw is low due to high lignin and silica content. The present study was carried out to enhance paddy straw digestibility and biogas production through sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pretreatment. The paddy straw was pretreated with NaOH by soaking (24 h) in different concentrations of NaOH (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10%) and supplementing with microwave irradiations (30 min, 720 W, 180 degrees C). 4% NaOH-30 min microwave was found to be the best pretreatment which resulted in 65.0% decrease in lignin content and 88.7% reduction in silica content. This increased digestibility due to reduced lignin and silica content resulted in 54.7% increase in biogas production.

Combination of ensiling and fungal delignification as effective wheat straw pretreatment,"Background: Utilization of lignocellulosic feedstocks for bioenergy production in developing countries demands competitive but low-tech conversion routes. White-rot fungi (WRF) inoculation and ensiling are two methods previously investigated for low-tech pretreatment of biomasses such as wheat straw (WS). This study was undertaken to assess whether a combination of forced ensiling with Lactobacillus buchneri and WRF treatment using a low cellulase fungus, Ceriporiopsis subvermispora, could produce a relevant pretreatment effect on WS for bioethanol and biogas production. Results: A combination of the ensiling and WRF treatment induced efficient pretreatment of WS by reducing lignin content and increasing enzymatic sugar release, thereby enabling an ethanol yield of 66 % of the theoretical max on the WS glucan, i.e. a yield comparable to yields obtained with high-tech, large-scale pretreatment methods. The pretreatment effect was reached with only a minor total solids loss of 5 % by weight mainly caused by the fungal metabolism. The combination of the biopretreatments did not improve the methane potential of the WS, but improved the initial biogas production rate significantly. Conclusion: The combination of the L. buchneri ensiling and C. subvermispora WRF treatment provided a significant improvement in the pretreatment effect on WS.

Effects of cell lysis in gas yield and sludge stabilization by combined process of thermophilic aerobic and anaerobic digestion,"A novel process of combining thermophilic (55 degrees C) aerobic digestion as pretreatment with mesophilic (<35 degrees C) anaerobic digestion process (TAD-MAD) was designed to stabilize sludge and produce CH4 biogas. TAD-MAD processes can yield energy-rich biogas, save aeration energy, short retention time, which is prior to single TAD or MAD process. TAD pretreatment play an important role in decomposing cell of sludges and enhancing the hydrolysis process. Other two pretreatment of Alkali and Ultrasonic following MAD process were investigated in this paper to compare with effect of TAD-MAD process on sludge stabilization and biogas production. The results showed that VSS removal rates for three processes of TAD-MAD, Alkali-MAD and Ultrasonication-MAD could achieve 40% at 10d or 11d, which can meet the requirements of the GB18918-2002 guidelines. soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) and volatile fatty acid (VFA) in the supernatant could increase to the highest values at initial 4d for three different processes, and subsequently decline during the latter part of digestion. For TAD-MAD process, SCOD and VFA could rapidly reach to the highest values 16000 mg/L and 7222 mg/L at initial 2d respectively, which achieved more significant effect on cell lysis. All three pretreatments improved biogas production, but TAD-MAD process could produce the most amounts of CH4 (481mL CH4 g-1 VSS) and cumulative biogas production of 12496mL at end of digestion. pH between 7.04 and 7.92 in three systems could maintain in neutral and subalkaline values. Alkalinities of sludge in three systems could meet need for methanogenic population inside the anaerobic digester.

Enhanced Biogas Production and Dewaterability from Sewage Sludge with Alkaline Pretreatment at Mesophilic and Thermophilic Temperatures,"This study investigated the biogas production and dewaterability of sewage sludge with alkaline pretreatment at mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures. The total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) of raw sludges were 21.1 +/- 2.3 and 16.2 +/- 1.5 g L-1, respectively. Raw sludges were pretreated at uncontrolled, pH 8, pH 10, and pH 12 under mesophilic (Mu, M8, M10, and M12) and thermophilic (Tu, T8, T10, and T12) conditions, respectively. All the pretreatments last 6 days. The pH of pretreated sludges was adjusted to the pH 7.0 prior to inoculating with mesophilic anaerobic digested sludge and undergoing 60 days of anaerobic digestion. The ultimate biogas yield of Mu, M8, M10, M12, Tu, T8, T10, and T12 was 296.8, 384.8, 339.9, 323.1, 376.6, 322.4, 271.5, and 258.1 mL g(-1)-VSadded, respectively. Both the pH of alkali treatment and temperature of thermal treatment affect the performance of anaerobic digestion. High hydrolysis pH (pH 10 and pH 12) resulted in high Na+ concentration (over 4000 mg L-1), and Na+ inhibitory effect reduced the ultimate biogas yield. The normalized capillary suction time (NCST) found in the treatments of M8 and Tu were 11.8 +/- 1.1 to 23.4 +/- 1.7 and 27.9 +/- 5.4 to 111.8 +/- 1.7 s g(-1)-TSS, respectively. The results suggest that both the pH of alkali treatment and temperatures of mild thermal treatment affect the performance of anaerobic digestion and sludge pretreated at pH 8.0 under mesophilic conditions could achieve high biogas yield and adequate dewaterability of digested sludge.","Wang, TF; Xu, BQ; Zhang, XY; Yang, QY; Xu, BJ; Yang, PH",Hydrolysis; Biogas yield; Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS); Dewaterability; Pretreatment,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-018-3726-0,Chemical,alkaline,,activated sludge,raw sludge,,,,,,,,,

High-rate biogas production from waste textiles using a two-stage process,"The efficacy of a two-stage Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR), modified as Stirred Batch Reactor (SBR), and Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket Bed (UASB) process in producing biogas from waste textiles was investigated under batch and semi-continuous conditions. Single-stage and two-stage digestions were compared in batch reactors, where 20 g/L cellulose loading, as either viscose/polyester or cotton/polyester textiles, was used. The results disclosed that the total gas production from viscose/polyester in a two-stage process was comparable to the production in a single-stage SBR, and in less than two weeks, more than 80% of the theoretical yield of methane was acquired. However, for cotton/polyester, the two-stage batch process was significantly superior to the single-stage; the maximum rate of methane production was increased to 80%, and the lag phase decreased from 15 days to 4 days. In the two-stage semi-continuous process, where the substrate consisted of jeans textiles, the effect of N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) pretreatment was studied. In this experiment, digestion of untreated and NMMO-treated jeans textiles resulted in 200 and 400 ml (respectively) methane/g volatile solids/day (ml/g VS/day), with an organic loading rate (OLR) of 2 g VS/L reactor volume/day (g VS/L/day); under these conditions, the NMMO pretreatment doubled the biogas yield, a significant improvement. The OLR could successfully be increased to 2.7 g VS/L/day, but at a loading rate of 4 g VS/L/day, the rate of methane production declined. By arranging a serial interconnection of the two reactors and their liquids in the two-stage process, a closed system was obtained that converted waste textiles into biogas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

NaOH Pretreatment of Wheat Straw at a Mesophilic Temperature: Effect on Hydrolysis and Loss of Organic Carbon,"A common approach to increasing biogas production is enhancing the hydrolysis of wheat straw by removing the lignin-using chemicals. However, partial organic matter will also dissolve into chemical solutions during pretreatment, which leads to the loss of organic matter for the anaerobic digestion process. The enzymatic hydrolysis of wheat straw and loss of total organic carbon increased with NaOH concentration and pretreatment time. The results suggest that when evaluating a pretreatment method, not just the hydrolysis but the loss of organic matter should be taken into consideration.","Jiang, H; Zeng, Y; Nie, H; Li, YQ; Ding, JT; Zhou, HJ",NaOH pretreatment; lignin; cellulase; total organic carbon (TOC); biogas,2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/62647,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,lignocellulose,wheat,straw,,,,,,,,
Effect of chemical pretreatment using sulfuric acid on biogas production from water hyacinth and kinetics,"The effect of chemical pretreatment on biogas production from water hyacinth (WH) was investigated. In pretreatment process, H2SO4 concentration was varied to be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 %v/v and residence time was varied to be 0, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 min. Effluents of pretreatment were used as biogas feedstock. The results showed that pretreatment changed not only the cellulose content but also the glucose, COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) and COD/N (COD/Nitrogen) ratio. Cellulose degradation occurred to follow first-order reaction based on the power law model. The best pretreatment condition was H2SO4 concentration of 5% v/v with residence time of 60 min because the slurry pretreated at that condition contained COD/N of 388.2. Anaerobic digestion of the slurry produced the biggest total biogas (42430 mL) with the highest methane content (64.38%). The pretreatment increased total biogas 131.45% compared to without pretreatment. The measured total biogas for 90 days was fitted by using modified Gompertz, Cone, First Order model in which they resulted fitting error of 0.271-9.789%, 0.032-8.743%, 3.491-5.681% respectively. In prediction using Ratkowsky and Phenomenogical model, the slurry containing optimum COD/N of 393 (total biogas 434.64 mL) was obtained with pretreatment of H2SO4 5%v/v for 65 min.

Enhancing enzymatic hydrolysis and biogas production from rice straw by pretreatment with organic acids,"Lignocellulosic biomass is recalcitrant to enzymatic and microbial degradation due to its chemical compositions and physical structures that inhibit the hydrolysis reactions. To obtain a high sugar yield for biofuel production, pretreatment process is generally needed to improve efficiency of hydrolysis. Here, organic acids were used to pretreat rice straw. Using Response Surface Methodology (RSM), the effect of three pretreatment parameters, including acid concentration, treatment time, and reaction temperature, on pretreatment efficiency were evaluated and used to generate mathematic optimization model. The hydrolysis results indicated that oxalic acid pretreatment led to the highest enhancement of enzymatic saccharification up to 213.4mg (starting from 500 mg of pretreated sample) when using 5.01% oxalic acid concentration at 135.91 degrees C for 30.86 min, which was 2.68 times higher than the untreated rice straw. The structural changes in the pretreated biomass were investigated using FT-IR analysis. The results suggested that lignin composition was significantly removed from the pretreated biomass, and the crystalline cellulose was also modified to amorphous form during pretreatment. Both untreated and pretreated rice straw were subjected to anaerobic digestion to evaluate the influence of organic acid pretreatment on biogas production. The highest biogas yield was 322.1 ml/g-rice straw when using citric acid pretreatment which was 7.40 times higher than untreated biomass. These results demonstrated that organic acids can be used for pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials to enhance hydrolysis and biogas production. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Microbial pretreatment using Kosakonia oryziphila IH3 to enhance biogas production and hydrocarbon depletion from petroleum refinery sludge,"Petroleum refinery sludge (PRS) from the biological treatment unit was assessed for the extent of anaerobic biodegradability and pollutant removal through microbial pretreatment utilizing a novel lignin peroxidase (LiP) enzyme-producing bacterial strain, Kosakonia oryziphila to optimize the accelerated solubilization of PRS. K. oryziphila was incubated at different dosages (10(7), 10(8) and 10(9) CFU/mL) for 6 d resulting in maximum soluble chemical oxygen demand (3-fold increment) and volatile fatty acids concentration (2.53-fold increment) against untreated for dosage 108 CFU/mL on 4th d. The maximum LiP activity (20.52 IU/mL) was obtained at optimum conditions. The interactive effect of pretreated substrate and inoculum (S/I) ratios and pH on accumulated biogas yield was optimized using central composite design-response surface methodology in 1 L batch assay. This resulted in significant interaction of independent variables to obtain an optimal condition (S/I = 2.69 and pH = 7.38) for maximum biogas (5.15 L/g VSadded) with 1.56-fold increment against untreated PRS. During process scale-up (20 L study), total petroleum hydrocarbon, oil and grease, and total phenol removals were 56.2%, 62.5% and 88.4% respectively within 50 d of digestion. The digestate phytotoxicity assay revealed a significant reduction in seed-germination inhibition with an increase in seedling and biomass growth suggesting improved decontamination during the digestion process.

Anaerobic co-digestion of catering waste with partially pretreated lignocellulosic crop residues,"Cellulosic crop residues are produced in large quantities in Pakistan and are considered resistant to biological degradation. Partial pretreatment of these crop residues and optimization of the feed rate could have a synergistic effect on the anaerobic co-digestion of organic waste. The aim of this study was to examine the possibility of enhancing biodegradation and biogas production from the anaerobic co-digestion of catering waste and cellulosic crop residues. Post-harvest crop residues (wheat straw and sugar cane bagasse) that are rich in lignocellulose were partially degraded using a combined microwave (800 J/g/min) and steam (121 degrees C, 40 min) pretreament. These pretreated wastes were co-digested with catering waste at different feeding rates (20-50% based on total solid, w/w) in batch conditions. High organic-matter removal efficiency was obtained from the feed composition of 20% pretreated wheat crop residues. Similarly, high levels of soluble chemical oxygen demand were observed (up to 85% conversion of insoluble chemical-oxygen demand) in the reactor containing the catering waste and pretreated crop residues. The accumulative biogas produced in both treatments was more than double the biogas observed in catering waste alone. The increased biogas production was due to the presence of more biodegradable carbon in the form of soluble chemical-oxygen demand. The results suggest that the use of a low-cost method (microwave and steam) for the partial pretreatment of lignocellulosic crop residues could increase rate of co-digestion and biogas production. This study provides a novel take on anaerobic co-digestion for the degradation of recalcitrant lignocellulosic material, and the development of an energy-efficient strategy for waste management.

Enhanced biogas production from anaerobic digestion of wastewater from the fruit juice industry by sonolysis: experiments and modelling,"The aim of this study is to investigate the use of ultrasound pretreatment as potential technique to solubilize organic matter and fermentation of fruit juice effluents in anaerobic batch reactor. The efficacy of ultrasound pretreatment has been assessed at low frequency of 20 kHz and at different sonication times (20, 40 and 60 min). Compared with control, the amount of biogas produced increased by 47, 57 and 60% for sonication times of 20, 40 and 60 min, respectively. Methane content of the produced biogas was about 59% in the control and 64% in the case of effluent subjected to ultrasonic for 60 min. After 20 days of anaerobic digestion of the fruit juice effluents, the efficiency of COD increased by 9, 31 and 35% with respect to control for sonication times of 20, 40 and 60 min, respectively, corresponding to total sugars uptake efficiency of about 35, 51 and 54%, respectively. The modified Gompertz equation was used to describe the cumulative biogas production.

Microwave-enhanced advanced oxidation process of biogas slurry from cow manure anaerobic digester,"In order to improve the sedimentation performance of biogas slurry and reduce the COD, microwave-enhanced advanced oxidation process (MW/H2O2-AOP) was used to pretreat the cow manure biogas slurry. A laboratory-scale microwave reactor was used to strengthen the H2O2 advanced oxidation process to achieve the solid-liquid separation of biogas slurry which was difficult to be settled. The results showed that the maximum COD removal efficiency reached 68.8% when pH, H2O2/total solid, microwave time and microwave power were 3, 0.4, 5min and 300W, respectively. COD was reduced from 24,157mg/L to 7536mg/L, and the settlings volume was reduced to 38%, while other pollutants such as the total solid and total dissolved solid were significantly reduced. Total solid and total dissolved solid removal efficiency reached 50.0% and 62.0%, respectively.

Solid-state anaerobic digestion of fungal pretreated Miscanthus sinensis harvested in two different seasons,"Solid-state anaerobic digestion of Miscanthus sinensis harvested in fall and spring was compared under different total solids contents and feedstock-to-inoculum ratios. The highest specific methane yields reached 170-175 L CH4/kg volatile solids for both harvest seasons. Miscanthus harvested in fall generated a 6% higher methane yield in average than miscanthus harvested in spring. Fungal pretreatment with Ceriporiopsis subvermispora decreased the lignin content of miscanthus harvested in spring by 25.7%, but there was no significant delignification observed for miscanthus harvested in fall. Fungal pretreatment of miscanthus harvested in spring increased the specific methane yield by 25%, but fungal pretreatment caused a slight methane yield reduction for miscanthus harvested in fall.

Establishment and assessment of a novel bioethanol and efficient biogas coupling fermentation system integrated with the pretreatment of a cellulolytic microbial consortium,"A novel bioethanol and biogas coupling fermentation system integrated with the pretreatment of a cellulolytic microbial consortium was proposed to treat cassava distillage. In the present study, 8 batches of ethanol fermentation integrated with 7 batches of biogas fermentation were successively proceeded. The recycled water after two-stage of anaerobic digestion was reused for raw material mixing in the later 7 batches of ethanol fermentation, whereas only tap water was used in the first batch. It was found the ethanol yield, starch utilization ratio, fermentation time can be kept steady at about 12.6%(v/v), 90% and 48 h respectively during the recycling process, which were very close to those of the conventional process using tap water. The organic substrates, volatile fatty acids, total and ammonia nitrogen reached steady states after 2-5 batches of recycling, while the total ion and alkalinity revealed a little decrease tendency with the increment of the recycling batches. Further, the total methane yield and methane producing velocity of each recycling batch in the proposed coupling system could reach 180-206 L and 40-45 L CH4 L-1 d(-1) (litres of methane generate per litre of reactor volume per day) respectively, which was 16.1-32.9% and 25-40.6% higher than those of the original one. In addition, the total mass yield obtained by the combination in the proposed coupling system was 317 g ethanol plus 68.7 g methane/kg cassava, and 8.3% higher energy was generated compared with the original system. In conclusion, the insertion of a biological pretreatment step into the proposed coupling system revealed obvious superiorities and applicable potentiat. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Bioenergy production from sweet sorghum stalks via a biorefinery perspective,"Besides free sugars, sweet sorghum stalks contain cellulose and hemicellulose that can be used for biofuel production. The pretreatment of stalks without the extraction of free sugars is more complicated than typical lignocelluloses, because of the degradation of free sugars during most pretreatment processes. In this study, the bioconversion of sweet sorghum stalks into biogas and bioethanol was studied using an improved organosolv pretreatment within a biorefinery framework. The organosolv pretreatment was developed using an aqueous solution of ethanol (EtOH) and isopropanol (IPOH). The process was optimized to obtain a liquor containing free sugars with the least sugar degradations together with a highly degradable solid fraction. The liquor was subjected to anaerobic digestion for biomethane production, while the solid was used for ethanol production via simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). The most influencing pretreatment parameters, i.e., temperature, time, alcohol to water ratio, EtOH to IPOH ratio, and the presence or absence of sulfuric acid (as a catalyst), were adjusted to achieve the highest yields of bioconversion. The maximum methane and ethanol production yields of 271.2 mL CH4/g VS and 87.8% (equal to the gasoline equivalent of 0.170 and 0.241 L/kg, respectively) were achieved from the liquor and pretreated solid, respectively; however, they were obtained at different optimum conditions. Considering the biorefinery perspective, the highest gasoline equivalent of 0.249 L/kg was efficiently obtained from the whole process after pretreatment at 140 A degrees C for 30 min using 60:20 EtOH/IPOH ratio in the presence of 1% sulfuric acid. Further analyses, including enzymatic adsorption/desorption, compositional analysis, FTIR, and SEM, were conducted to investigate the effects of this newly developed pretreatment on the substrate.","Nozari, B; Mirmohamadsadeghi, S; Karimi, K",Biogas; Ethanol; Sweet sorghum stalk; Organosolv pretreatment; Enzymatic hydrolysis,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-8833-8,Chemical,solvent,organosolv ethanol+isopropanol,lignocellulose,sorghum,stalk,,,,,,,,
The effect of pretreatment methods for improved biogas production from oil-palm empty fruit bunches (EFB): experimental and model,"The production of biogas from solid wastes in addition to palm oil mill effluents is necessary due to the shortage of the effluents, operation of biogas plants at low to moderate capacities, and large amount of solid wastes, particularly oil-palm empty fruit bunches (EFB). However, the biogas production from raw EFB gives low yield. This study therefore aims to investigate the effect of EFB pretreatment methods on the improvement of biogas production. The pretreatment of EFB was carried out through chemical (NaOH solutions), physical (size reduction) and biological (activated sludge and bio-scrubber effluent) processes. The experimental data was tested against corrected Gompertz model. The results showed that size reduction and pretreatments of EFB with 7% w/v NaOH, activated sludge and bio-scrubber effluent could improve biogas yield significantly and differently. The highest yield of methane was 429.9 ml/g.VS, obtained from EFB with size reduction. For the pretreatments of EFB with 7% w/v NaOH, bio-scrubber effluent and activated sludge, the methane yields were 345.5, 326.4 and 297.3 ml/g.VS, respectively. Without pretreatment, the methane yield was only 226.0 ml/g.VS. The change in cellulose and lignin compositions of EFB after pretreatment is attributed to the improvement of biogas yield.

Ultrasound assisted biogas production from landfill leachate,"The aim of this study is to increase biogas production and methane yield from landfill leachate in anaerobic batch reactors by using low frequency ultrasound as a pretreatment step. In the first part of the study, optimum conditions for solubilization of organic matter in leachate samples were investigated using various sonication durations at an ultrasound frequency of 20 kHz. The level of organic matter solubilization during ultrasonic pretreatment experiments was determined by calculating the ratio of soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) to total chemical oxygen demand (tCOD). The sCOD/tCOD ratio was increased from 47% in raw leachate to 63% after 45 min sonication at 600 W/I. Non-parametric Friedman's test indicated that ultrasonic pretreatment has a significant effect on sCOD parameter for leachate (p < 0.05). In the second part of the study, anaerobic batch reactors were operated for both ultrasonically pretreated and untreated landfill leachate samples in order to assess the effect of sonication on biogas and methane production rate. In anaerobic batch reactor feed with ultrasonically pretreated leachate, 40% more biogas was obtained compared to the control reactor. For statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare biogas and methane production rates for raw and pretreated leachate samples and it has been found that ultrasonic pretreatment significantly enhanced biogas and methane production rates from leachate (p < 0.05) in anaerobic batch reactors. The overall results showed that low frequency ultrasound pretreatment can be potentially used for wastewater management especially with integration of anaerobic processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluation of methane production from liquid hot water pretreated Paspalum atratum and Brachiaria ruziziensis as alternative energy substrates,"Atratum and ruzi grasses have illustrated high potential for methane production through anaerobic digestion. To enhance the utilization of these grasses for the production of renewable biogas, liquid hot water pretreatment was applied to break down various lignocellulose matter, in particular, hemicellulose. After pretreatment under optimal conditions (200 degrees C for 15 min), more than 90% of hemicellulose was removed and solubilized in the form of a clear hydrolysate. Xylose was the primary sugar in the hydrolysate, appearing in several forms, and acting as the major substrate for methane production. Total xylose yields for the atratum and ruzi grasses were 58 and 74 mg/g TS respectively. The pretreated atratum and ruzi substrates were evaluated for methane production resulting in an increased methane yield of at least 14%, and more than 70% biodegradability. This work demonstrates the potential for atratum and ruzi grasses to be used as a viable alternative to other energy crops such as Napier grass.","Varongchayakul, S; Tinrung, N; Lerdlattaporn, R; Songkasiri, W; Chaiprasert, P",Atratum grass; Biogas production; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Ruzi grass; Xylose,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.114784,Physical,thermal,liquid hot water,lignocellulose,grass,grass,,,,,,,,
Biomethanation macrodynamics of vegetable residues pretreated by low-frequency microwave irradiation,"The effects of microwave irradiation on the digestibility and biogas production of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis) and cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) leaves were investigated using biochemical methane potential (BMP) assays.

Inverted phase fermentation as a pretreatment for anaerobic digestion of cattle manure and sewage sludge,"The aim of this research study was to analyse the effect of applying inverted phase fermentation (IPF) prior to the anaerobic digestion of cattle manure and sewage sludge. IPF promotes the endogenous bacteria present in waste and hence enzymatic hydrolysis, producing a solid-liquid separation. The clarified bottom layer or liquid phase (LP, 70% volume in manure and 65% in sludge), and the thickened top layer or solid phase (SP, 30% volume in manure and 35% in sludge) were digested separately. Operating at 37 degrees C, the time needed to digest the LP from manure was shorter (10 days) than that needed to digest the corresponding SP or the untreated substrate (22 days in both cases). The time needed to digest the separated phases of sludge (LP: 2 days, SP: 15 days) was lower than that needed to digest manure. Biogas production rates for the manure after pretreatment were 0.5 L/L day for the SP and 0.7 L/L. day for the LP, allowing higher OLR (4.5-4.8 gCOD/L.day) than when digesting untreated manure and increasing biogas production by 17%. IPF applied to sewage sludge led to a production of 1.8 L/L. day at an OLR of 6.2 gCOD/L.day for the SP and 2.0 L/L.day at 12.9 gCOD/L.day for the LP. Assuming a conventional OLR of 2-3 gCOD/L.day, the advantage of applying IPF to sewage sludge resides in the possibility of operating digesters at much higher OLR.

Evaluation of agronomic properties of digestate from macroalgal residues anaerobic digestion: Impact of pretreatment and co-digestion with waste activated sludge,"The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of pretreating macroalgal residue (MAR) from agar-agar extraction and its co-digestion with sewage sludge on methane production and the agronomic quality of the digestates produced. First, different pretreatments were assessed on BMP tests. Among milling technologies used, knife milling with a 4 mm-screen improved methane production by 25%. The MAR was then knife milled before alkaline, acid and thermal pretreatment. KOH pretreatment (5% TS basis, 25 degrees C for 2 days) led to the highest methane improvement. It was applied to semi-continuous anaerobic digestion and methane production achieved 237 Nml/gVS which was 20% higher than the control (198 Nml/gVS). In comparison to MAR mono-digestion, co-digestion with thickened activated sludge produced less methane (184 Nml/gVS) but reduced H2S emission by 91%. None of the digestates was toxic for the germination or growth of wheat and tomato plants. Particularly, co-digestion had the highest impact on tomato plant dry weight (+94% compared to soil alone) mainly due to the phosphorous brought by sludge.

"Enzyme Pretreatment Enhancing Biogas Yield from Corn Stover: Feasibility, Optimization, and Mechanism Analysis","In this study, feasibility, optimization, and mechanisms of enzyme pretreatment to enhance anaerobic digestion of corn stover were investigated. Results showed that the enzyme pretreatment efficiently enhanced the biogas yield, and the optimal conditions of enzyme pretreatment were an enzyme load of 30 FPU/g, a pretreatment time of 24 h, and a solid content of 60 g/L. Under the optimal conditions, the cumulative biogas yield increased by 36.9%, which was mainly attributed to disruption of surface structure and degradation of noncrystalline cellulose in the enzyme-pretreated corn stover. The kinetic analysis indicated that enzyme pretreatment significantly enhanced the hydrolysis rate and biogas production rate to 0.15/d and 23.89 mL/gVS, and shortened the lag phase time to 1.2 d. Correlation analysis illustrated that the SCOD yield of 250-350 mg/g from corn stover after enzyme pretreatment was suitable for the further anaerobic digestion of corn stover.","Wang, SQ; Li, F; Wu, D; Zhang, PY; Wang, HJ; Tao, X; Ye, JP; Nabi, M",corn stover; enzyme pretreatment; biogas production; lignocellulosic structure; kinetic analysis,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b03086,Biological,enzyme,,lignocellulose,corn,stover,,,,,,,,
Effect of Acid Whey Pretreatment Using Ultrasonic Disintegration on the Removal of Organic Compounds and Anaerobic Digestion Efficiency,"Acid whey is a by-product of the dairy industry that should be utilized or appropriately neutralized. Anaerobic processes represent a group of prospective methods for whey processing, and a key priority in their development is to improve their technological and economical effectiveness. The present study aimed to determine the effect of ultrasonic disintegration (UD) of acid whey on the course and effectiveness of methane fermentation. The study results demonstrated that extending the UD duration resulted in increased concentrations of dissolved forms of COD and TOC, efficiency of organic matter biodegradation, and CH4 production. The best effects were achieved at 900 s US, including CH4 production of 0.203 +/- 0.01 dm(3)/gCOD(in.) and CH4 content accounting for 70.9 +/- 2.8%. Organic compounds were removed with the following efficiencies: COD-78.7 +/- 2.1%, TOC-80.2 +/- 1.3%, and BOD5-84.1 +/- 1.6%. The highest net energy gain of 5.763 Wh was achieved upon UD of 300 s. Extension of UD time had no significant effect on the improvement in the energetic effectiveness of anaerobic digestion. A strong positive correlation was found between COD and TOC concentrations in the dissolved phase and CH4 production yield.","Kazimierowicz, J; Zielinski, M; Bartkowska, I; Debowski, M",acid whey; ultrasonic disintegration; methane fermentation; biogas; pretreatment; bacterial community,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811362,Physical,ultrasonic,,food industry organic waste,acid whey,,,,,,,,,
"Effect of thermal pretreatment on chemical composition, physical structure and biogas production kinetics of wheat straw","Hard lignocellulosic structure of wheat straw is the main hindrance in its anaerobic digestion. Thus, a laboratory scale batch experiment was conducted to study the effect of thermal pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of wheat straw. For this purpose, different thermal pretreatment temperatures of 120, 140, 160 and 180 degrees C were studied and the results were compared with raw wheat straw. Significant differences in biogas production were observed at temperature higher than 160 degrees C. Highest biogas yield of 615 Nml/gVS and volatile solids reduction of 69% was observed from wheat straw pretreated at 180 degrees C. Wheat straw pretreated at 180 degrees C showed 53% higher biogas yield as compared to untreated. Further, FTIR analysis revealed change in chemical bonds of lignocellulosic structure of wheat straw. Modified Gompertz model was best fitted on biogas production data and predicted shorter lag phase time and higher biogas production as the pretreatment temperature increased. Overall, change in lignocellulosic structure and increase in cellulose content were the main reason in enhancing biogas production.","Rajput, AA; Zeshan; Visvanathan, C",Thermal pretreatment; Wheat straw; Lignocellulosic material; Biogas production; Kinetic model,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.05.011,Physical,thermal,,lignocellulose,wheat,straw,,,,,,,,
Optimization of microwave pretreatment conditions to maximize methane production and methane yield in mesophilic anaerobic sludge digestion,"The objective of this study was to find optimum microwave pretreatment conditions for methane production and methane yield in anaerobic sludge digestion. The sludge was pretreated using a laboratory-scale industrial microwave unit (2450 MHz frequency). Microwave temperature increase rate (TIR) (2.9-17.1 degrees C/min) and final temperature (FT) (52-108 degrees C) significantly affected solubilization, methane production, and methane yield. Solubilization degree (soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD)/total COD) in the pretreated sludge (3.3-14.7%) was clearly higher than that in the raw sludge (2.6%). Within the design boundaries, the optimum conditions for maximum methane production (2.02 L/L) were TIR = 9.1 degrees C/min and FT = 90 degrees C, and the optimum conditions for maximum methane yield (809 mL/g VS removed) were TIR = 7.1 degrees C/min and FT = 92 degrees C.","Park, WJ; Ahn, JH",biogas; central composite design; microwave pretreatment; response surface analysis; sludge,2011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2010.543929,Physical,thermal,microwave,activated sludge,mixed sludge,,,,,,,,,
Steam explosion pretreatment of coffee husks: a strategy towards decarbonization in a biorefinery approach,"BACKGROUND Coffee husks (CH) are an abundant lignocellulosic residue that can be converted into biofuels and bioproducts through sustainable and economical processes in a biorefinery approach. For that, steam explosion (SE) pretreatment stands out as a technique to overcome its recalcitrant nature and enable byproduct valorization. In this study, solid and liquid fractions were separated after pretreatment for saccharification and biogas production, respectively. The research relevance relies on the contribution to environment decarbonization and monetization of decarbonization credits (CBIO) generated from the production of renewable fuel from waste biomass under different operational conditions (with and without pretreatment). RESULTS Liquid hydrolysate generated by SE condition at 210 degrees C and 15 min led to the highest biomethane production (292 NmL CH4 g CODfed-1). Similarly, high-severity pretreatment also favored the enzymatic hydrolysis yield of the solid fraction (49%). In terms of environment decarbonization, SE promoted not only a lower carbon intensity when compared to the process without any pretreatment (3.8 vs. 6.4 g CO2eq MJ(-1)), but also increased the monetization of decarbonization credits by 175%, which represented a potential revenue of US $1 481 330. CONCLUSION High temperatures of SE pretreatment of CH at 210 degrees C were able to promote biogas production and fermentable sugars. In addition, the process reduced carbon emissions and increased the revenue from CBIO commercialization. Therefore, SE proved to be a sustainable and economic alternative for consideration in new green businesses from lignocellulosic residues such as CH.

Ultrasound pretreatment for enhanced biogas production from olive mill wastewater,"This study investigates applicability of low frequency ultrasound technology to olive mill wastewaters (OMWs) as a pretreatment step prior to anaerobic batch reactors to improve biogas production and methane yield. OMWs originating from three phase processes are characterized with high organic content and complex nature. The treatment of the wastewater is problematic and alternative treatment options should be investigated. In the first part of the study, OMW samples were subjected to ultrasound at a frequency of 20 kHz with applied powers varying between 50 and 100W under temperature controlled conditions for different time periods in order to determine the most effective sonication conditions. The level of organic matter solubilization at ultrasound experiments was assessed by calculating the ratio of soluble chemical oxygen demand/total chemical oxygen demand (SCOD/TCOD). The results revealed that the optimum ultrasonic condition for diluted OMW is 20 kHz, 0.4 W/mL for 10 min. The application of ultrasound to OMW increased SCOD/TCOD ratio from 0.59 to 0.79. Statistical analysis (Friedman's tests) show that ultrasound was significantly effective on diluted OMW (p < 0.05) in terms of SCOD parameter, but not for raw OMW (p > 0.05). For raw OMW, this increase has been found to be limited due to high concentration of suspended solids (SS). In the second part of the study, biogas and methane production rates of anaerobic batch reactor fed with the ultrasound pretreated OMW samples were compared with the results of control reactor fed with untreated OMW in order to determine the effect of sonication. A nonparametric statistical procedure, Mann-Whitney U test, was used to compare biogas and methane production from anaerobic batch reactors for control and ultrasound pretreated samples. Results showed that application of low frequency ultrasound to OMW significantly improved both biogas and methane production in anaerobic batch reactor fed with the wastewater (p < 0.05). Anaerobic batch reactor fed with ultrasound pretreated diluted OMW produced approximately 20% more biogas and methane compared with the untreated one (control reactor). The overall results indicated that low frequency ultrasound pretreatment increased soluble COD in OMW and subsequently biogas production. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of heat pre-treatment on the anaerobic digestion of high-solid pig manure under high organic loading level,"Since more and more large-scale farms appear in China and changes in fecal sewage source disposal, the production of high-concentration solid manure waste is also increasing, and its conversion and utilization are gaining attention. This study investigated the effect of heat pre-treatment (HPT) on the thermophilic anaerobic digestion (AD) of high-solid manure (HSM). Pig manure (PM) feed with a total solids of 13% was used for the HPT and subsequent anaerobic digestion (AD) test. The HPT was carried out at 60 degrees C, 80 degrees C, and 100 degrees C, respectively, for 15 min after the heating reached the set temperature. The results show that HPT led to PM feed COD solubilization, observing a maximum increase of 24.57% after pretreated at 100 degrees C, and the treated PM feed under this condition received the maximum methane production potential of 264.64 mLmiddotg(-1) VS in batch AD test, which was 28.76% higher than that of the untreated group. Another semi-continuous AD test explored the maximum volume biogas production rate (VBPR). It involves two organic loading rates (OLR) of 13.4 and 17.8 g VSaddedmiddotL(-1)middotd(-1). The continuous test exhibited that all the HPT groups could produce biogas normally when the OLR increased to the high level, while the digester fed with untreated PM showed failure. The maximum VBPR of 4.71 L L(-1)middotd(-1) was observed from PM feed after pre-treated at 100 degrees C and running at the high OLR. This reveals that thermal treatment can weaken the impact of a larger volume of feed on the AD system. Energy balance analysis demonstrates that it is necessary to use a heat exchanger to reuse energy in the HPT process to reduce the amount of energy input. In this case, the energy input to energy output (Ei/Eo) ranged from 0.34 to 0.55, which was much less than one, suggesting that biogas increment due to heat treatment can reasonably cover the energy consumption of the pre-treatment itself.

Initially, a novel soaking pretreatment (NaOH and aqueous-ammonia) for CS was developed to remove lignin, swell the biomass, and improve enzymatic digestibility. Based on the sugar yield during enzymatic hydrolysis, the optimal pretreatment conditions were 1 % NaOH + 8 % NH4OH, 50A degrees C, 48 h, with a solid-to-liquid ratio 1:10. The results demonstrated that soaking pretreatment removed 63.6 % lignin while reserving most of the carbohydrates. After enzymatic hydrolysis, the yields of glucose and xylose were 78.5 % and 69.3 %, respectively. The simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of pretreated CS using Pichia stipitis resulted in an ethanol concentration of 36.1 g/L, corresponding only to 63.3 % of the theoretical maximum. In order to simplify the process and reduce the capital cost, the liquid fraction of the pretreatment was used to re-soak new CS. For methane production, the re-soaked CS and the residues of SSF were anaerobically digested for 120 days. Fifteen grams CS were converted to 1.9 g of ethanol and 1337.3 mL of methane in the entire process.","Zuo, Z; Tian, S; Chen, ZB; Li, J; Yang, XS",Corn stover; Pretreatment; Re-soaking; Enzymatic hydrolysis; SSF; Biogas production,2012,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-012-9751-3,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,lignocellulose,corn,stover,,,,,,,,

Anaerobic co-digestion of catering food waste utilizing Parthenium hysterophorus as co-substrate for biogas production,"Catering food waste is a constant concern both at home and in the restaurant kitchens. Advances in the catering industry are generating a significant amount of catering waste, which poses a significant risk to public health and the environment. The anaerobic digestion technology used to produce biogas from various substrates has attracted worldwide attention for its economics and ease of use. This study evaluated the potential of pretreated parthenium weed (as co-substrate) in anaerobic co-digestion of catering food waste in lab scale bioreactors using different mixing ratios (0:100, 20:80, 60:40, 40:60, 80:20, and 100:0 TS basis) for biogas production. The performance parameters of the bioprocess were evaluated using COD, C/N ratio, solids content, pH and the biogas potential. The results showed that the maximum biogas production rate (559 ml L-1 d(-1)) and accumulative biogas (5532 ml L-1) was achieved in the PCP2 co-digestion reactor, where 60% catering food waste and 40% parthenium weed (pre-treated) was used under static incubation at 30 +/- 1 degrees C. Furthermore, in response to pretreatment conditions, a steady decrease in volatile solids (VS), total solids (TS), C/N ratio, and organic content were observed. The highest removal efficiency of organic matter (38.9%) was achieved by the PCP2 co-digestion reactor with a maximum reduction of 79% of iCOD in 60 process days.

Anaerobic co-digestion of water hyacinth and banana peels with and without thermal pretreatment,"This study evaluates the effect of mixing ratio (1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5) and hot air oven pretreatment on the anaerobic co-digestion of water hyacinth and banana peels. Two sets of bio-chemical methane potential (BMP) tests were performed concurrently. In set I, untreated water hyacinth was mixed with banana peels and in set II, water hyacinth was pretreated before co-digestion. Fixed amount of cow dung was added to each reactor as an inoculum. The anaerobic batch test revealed that set II, where pretreated water hyacinth and banana peels was co-digested, demonstrated higher biogas production and better quality of biogas than set I. Mixing ratio 2 and 1.5 were illustrated to be the optimal mixing ratio for set I and II respectively. Both the sets illustrated higher biogas generation than mono-digestion of the substrates. Thus, anaerobic co-digestion of water hyacinth and banana peels portrayed a synergistic action by balancing the overall process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of hydrothermal pretreatment and bamboo hydrochar addition on anaerobic digestion of tofu residue for biogas production,"The effect of hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) of tofu residue (TR) and co-digestion of TR with hydrochar (HC) and a liquid fraction (LF) of hydrothermal pretreatment on biogas production was studied.

Evaluation of pressurised carbon dioxide pre-treatment aimed at improving the sanitisation and anaerobic digestibility of co-settled sewage sludge,"This work reports on the use of pressurized CO2 pretreatment to improve methane yield and pathogen indicator organism die-off in co-settled sewage sludge (SS). Four semi-continuous mesophilic anaerobic digesters were fed on co-settled SS to establish a baseline for performance and stability. One pair of digesters was then fed with co-settled SS pretreated by P CO2 at 2800kPa for 23h. The trial continued for 70days during which specific biogas and methane production, volatile solids destruction and loss of viability of Escherichia coli was monitored in test and control digesters. The pretreatment had no positive influence on any of these parameters, which was further confirmed using batch biochemical methane potential tests and direct measurement of die-off of E. coli and Salmonella enterica in samples of different sizes treated in pressure vessels of different sizes and in matrices of nutrient medium and co-settled SS. Pressurised CO2 pretreatment was effective at killing fecal indicator bacteria in nutrient medium but ineffectual in SS, strongly suggesting that the nature of suspending matrix was a principle determining factor. Paper concludes that pressurized CO2 pretreatment is not a satisfactory approach to improve either biogas production or pathogen destruction in anaerobic digestion.","Mushtaq, M; Banks, CJ; Heaven, S",Biogas; cell disruption; fecal indicator organism; pathogen; pretreatment; sewage sludge,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2018.1516082,Chemical,acidic,co2 pressurized,activated sludge,sewage sludge,,,,,,,,,
Enhanced biogas production potential of microalgae and swine wastewater using co-digestion and alkaline pretreatment,"Biogas yield obtained from anaerobic digestion of swine wastewater (SWW) needs to be increased to produce electrical energy. To enhance biogas and prevent pollution, use of mixed culture microalgae grown in wastewater (MWW) with SWW has attracted a lot of interest. This research was focused on the possibility of utilizing MWW. Six experiments using raw SWW and MWW, and their co-digestion were conducted on a laboratory scale in one-litre reactors with the ratio of inoculum and substrate of 70:30 under without and with alkaline pretreatment (using 3% NaOH for pH adjustment every 15 min at pH 11 for 3 h). The results showed that co-digestion had the major effect on increasing biogas and methane yields (0.735 and 0.326 m(3)/kg of volatile solids (VS) removed), and the highest chemical oxygen demand and VS removal (60.29% and 63.17%). For pretreatment, the effect of ammonia inhibition at a high pH of 11 had more influence on biodegradation than the effect of destruction of MWW's cell walls, resulting in a low biogas production of pretreated MWW and pretreated co-digestion. These findings affirm the potential of co-digestion, and the possibility of using both single and co-substrate MWW. Pretreatment could be improved at a lower alkaline pH condition. A pilot scale of co-digestion should be performed.","Panyaping, K; Khiewwijit, R; Wongpankamol, P",alkaline pretreatment; biogas; co-digestion; mixed culture microalgae; swine wastewater,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2018.077,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,codigestion,microalgae,,,,,,,,,
Alkaline electro-hydrolysis pretreatment of rice straw for enhanced biogas production under ambient temperature,"Biogas production can supplement the renewable energy target of the world. For this abundantly available agricultural waste like wheat and rice straw can be used. Biogas generation using this waste will curb the stubble burning incidences, reduce greenhouse gases, enhance farmer's income, and strengthen the energy security of many countries. The recalcitrant nature of rice straw is a barrier to its hydrolysis, which is a prerequisite of the anaerobic digestion (AD) process. Alkaline, electro-hydrolysis, and a combination of both pretreatment (alkaline electrohydrolysis) methods are undertaken in the present study. Batch reactors at ambient temperature were used for AD of rice straw at different inoculums to substrate ratios (ISR) of 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 to observe the effect on biogas/methane yield. Among these, a higher amount of biogas was obtained for ISR of 0.5 in all sets of experiments. The combined pretreatment method yielded biogas of 315.9 mL/gVS (equivalent to methane of 167.4 mL/gVS). For pretreat-ed rice straw by electro-hydrolysis, alkaline, and combined (alkaline and electro-hydrolysis) respectively, the methane yields were 7.03, 18.13, and 49.82% higher than untreated rice straw.

Assessing the agricultural reuse of the digestate from microalgae anaerobic digestion and co-digestion with sewage sludge,"Microalgae anaerobic digestion produces biogas along with a digestate that may be reused in agriculture. However, the properties of this digestate for agricultural reuse have yet to be determined. The aim of this study was to characterise digestates from different microalgae anaerobic digestion processes (i.e. digestion of untreated microalgae, thermally pretreated microalgae and thermally pretreated microalgae in co-digestion with primary sludge). The main parameters evaluated were organic matter, macronutrients and heavy metals content, hygenisation, potential phytotoxicity and organic matter stabilisation. According to the results, all microalgae digestates presented suitable organic matter and macronutrients, especially organic and ammonium nitrogen, for agricultural soils amendment. However, the thermally pretreated microalgae digestate was the least stabilised digestate in comparison with untreated microalgae and co-digestion digestates. In vivo bioassays demonstrated that the digestates did not show residual phytotoxicity when properly diluted, being the co-digestion digestate the one which presented less phytotoxicity. Heavy metals contents resulted far below the threshold established by the European legislation on sludge spreading. Moreover, low presence of E. coli was observed in all digestates. Therefore, agricultural reuse of thermally pretreated microalgae and primary sludge co-digestate through irrigation emerges a suitable strategy to recycle nutrients from wastewater.

The effect of process parameters during the thermal-expansionary pretreatment of wheat straw on hydrolysate quality and on biogas yield,"This paper was dedicated to evaluate the impact of thermal-expansionary pretreatment on the quality of hydrolysate and on biogas yield. An aqueous suspension containing 5% wt. of wheat straw was treated under process temperature 170-200 degrees C with residence time 0-60 min. It has been proven that the organic biomass loss of straw, the rate of disruptions in its microstructure, COD, glucose and acetic acid yields in the liquid phase of hydrolysate increased with an increasing process temperature and residence time, while acidity decreased. This technology has also significantly increased methane yield. A maximum increase of 41% was reached at process temperature 170 degrees C and residence time 20 min. Nevertheless, based on energy balance of the treatment, it was determined, that heat of regeneration is lower than heat needed to reach process temperature. An addition heat source must be therefore installed in the technology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the co-digestion of 50% microalgae - 50% wheat straw was investigated in mesophilic lab-scale reactors. The results showed that the methane yield was increased by 77% with the co-digestion as compared to microalgae mono-digestion, while the pretreatment only increased the methane yield by 15% compared to the untreated mixture.

Anaerobic co-digestion of microalgal biomass and wheat straw with and without thermo-alkaline pretreatment,"This study aimed at analyzing the anaerobic co-digestion of microalgal biomass grown in wastewater and wheat straw.

Evaluation of operational parameters for semi-continuous anaerobic digester treating pretreated waste activated sludge,"Experimental analysis of citric acid and bacterial pretreatment on waste activated sludge (WAS) was performed in a semi-continuous anaerobic reactor for assessing the sludge reduction. The sludge pretreatment was carried out by deflocculating the WAS using 50mM/L citric acid and subjecting to bacterial disintegration using 2g dry cell weight/L of Bacillus licheniformis. The pretreatment resulted in a COD solubilization of about 40%. Anaerobic digestion (AD) of pretreated sludge was carried out in a 3.5 L semi-continuous anaerobic reactor. The AD results reveal that an organic loading rate (OLR) of 1g/Ld operated at 15d hydraulic retention time was preferably the pertinent OLR for the efficient digestion.

Enzymatic pretreatment of algal biomass has different optimal conditions for biogas and bioethanol routes,"Enzymatic pretreatment is emerging as an efficient tool for the extraction of biofuel precursors from algal biomass. However, yardsticks for end-use directed selection of optimal pretreatment conditions are not yet identified. The present study, for the first time, reveals different optimal conditions for algal biomass solubilization and sugar release. Algal biomass pretreatment optimization was carried out using the Taguchi method. Crude enzyme from Aspergillus fischeri was found effective for pretreatment of Chlorella pyrenoidosa. Maximum sugar yield (190 mg g(-1) biomass) from algal biomass was observed at a substrate concentration of 4 g L-1, with a 5% enzyme load at temperature 60 degrees C, pH 5.5, and shaking speed of 80 rpm. In contrast, maximum sCOD (1350 mg g(-1) biomass) was obtained at 2 g L-1 substrate concentration with enzyme load of 20% v/v, at 60 degrees C, pH 4, and shaking speed of 100 rpm. Hence, the first set of conditions would be more beneficial for bioethanol production. Whereas another set of conditions would improve the biofuel production that requires maximum solubilization of algal biomass, such as fermentative methane production. Overall, the present observations established that process conditions required for enzymatic pretreatment of algal biomass should be selected according to the desired biofuel type.","Bhushan, S; Rana, MS; Bhandari, M; Sharma, AK; Simsek, H; Prajapati, SK",Crude enzyme; Algal biomass; Enzymatic pretreatment; Taguchi method; Biogas; Bioethanol,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131264,Biological,enzyme,crude enzyme Aspergillus fischeri,micro-algae,chlorella,,,,,,,,,
Enhanced biogas yield by thermo-alkali solubilization followed by co-digestion of intestine waste from slaughterhouse with food waste,"Intestine waste generated from slaughterhouse (IWS) is difficult to degrade in anaerobic process due to the presence of high protein and lipid contents.

The effects of four variables, alkalines (NaOH, KOH, Ca(OH)(2)), treatment time (15-180 min), pH (8-11) and rpm (4000-24,000) were investigated. The effect of sludge pretreatment was evaluated by COD solubilization, suspended solids reduction and biogas production.

Optimization of Cassava Pulp Pretreatment by Liquid Hot Water for Biomethane Production,"Cassava pulp (CP) is considered as a major and low-cost agro-industrial solid byproduct of cassava starch processing, where 48% of starch granules was still entrapped in its complex lignocellulosic matrix of cell wall structure with 21% cellulose and 8% hemicellulose. In this study, the liquid hot water (LHW) pretreatment was aimed to disrupt the cell wall structure of CP and solubilized hemicellulose and starch into saccharides to enhance biomethane production. Reaction conditions of LHW pretreatment, temperature (160-200 degrees C), and time (0-30 min) were optimized by response surface methodology. LHW pretreatment at 187 degrees C for 7 min boosted the highest level of starch and hemicellulose solubilization into the liquid phase, resulting in the maximized glucose yield of 444 mg/gCP. Starch and hemicellulose were mostly removed from CP at 99 and 79%, respectively, while 68% cellulose and 10% lignin particularly remained in solid residue. The disrupted cell wall structure and crystalline cellulose after LHW pretreatment were also observed. Microbial inhibitors such as furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural were found in low concentration at 31 and 32 mu g/mL, respectively. In addition, there were no lag phase and inhibitory effect during anaerobic digestion of the pretreated CP. Biochemical methane potential of the LHW-pretreated CP showed the methane production rate and methane yield at 1.6 times and 35% higher than that of non-pretreated CP, respectively, by shortening anaerobic digestion time from 22 d to 10 d. It was shown that LHW was an efficient chemical-free method for enhancing biodegradability of CP in conversion to biomethane.","Varongchayakul, S; Songkasiri, W; Chaiprasert, P",Biogas; Biomass; Central composite design; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Inhibitors; Saccharides production,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-020-10238-0,Physical,thermal,liquid hot water,lignocellulose,cassava,pulp,,,,,,,,
The Influence of Corn Straw Extrusion Pretreatment Parameters on Methane Fermentation Performance,"The aim of the study is to determine the energy consumption of the extrusion-cooking process of corn straw under various conditions (screw speed, moisture content), water absorption measurements and water solubility indices as well as biogas efficiency evaluation. The extrusion-cooking of corn straw was carried out using a single screw extruder with L/D = 16:1 at various rotational screw speeds (70, 90, and 110 rpm) and with various initial moisture content of raw material (25 and 40%). Prior to the process, the moisture content of the raw material was measured, and next, it was moistened to 25 and 40% of dry matter. For example, at 70 rpm extruder screw speed, the temperature range was 126-150 degrees C. Energy consumption of straw pretreatment through extrusion-cooking was assessed in order to evaluate the possibility of using the process in an agricultural biogas plant. Biogas and methane efficiency of substrates after extrusion was tested in a laboratory scale biogas plant and expressed as a volume of cumulative methane production for fresh matter, dry matter, and dry organic matter. Pretreated corn straw moistened to 25% and processed at 110 rpm during the extrusion-cooking processing produced the most advantageous effect for methane and biogas production (51.63%) efficiency as compared to corn straw without pretreatment (49.57%). Rotational speed of the extruder screw influenced biogas and methane production. With both dry matter and dry organic matter, the increase of rotational speed of the extruder screw improved the production of cumulated biogas and methane. Pretreatment of corn straw has a positive effect on the acquisition of cumulated methane (226.3 Nm(3)Mg(-1)for fresh matter, 243.99 Nm(3)Mg(-1)for dry matter, and 254.83 Nm(3)Mg(-1)for dry organic matter).

Enhancement mechanism of biogas potential from lignocellulosic substrates in the ensiling process via acid-based hydrolysis and biological degradation,"This study investigated the effects of acid-based hydrolysis and biological degradation during the ensiling process as a pretreatment for biogas production. In nine separate treatments, lactic, acetic, and butyric acid were added to wilted maize stover at 20, 50, and 80 g/kg dry matter (DM) and then ensiled for 60 d. Synergetic effects of acid-based hydrolysis and biological degradation were observed in the three treatments with an organic acid addition of 20 g/kg of DM, which resulted in a lignocellulose degradation rate (LDR) of 26%-31% and a biomethane potential (BMP) increase of 10%-13% with respect to that of the raw material. However, in the treatments with an organic acid addition of 80 g/kg of DM, although the biological degradation was almost completely inhibited, the LDR was still 20%-24% and the BMP increased by 6%-8% with respect to that of the raw material. These results showed that acid-based hydrolysis played a dominant role in increasing the BMP (accounting for 55%-65%) and that biological degradation was able to further enhance biodigestibility. Therefore, the authors suggest that an ensiling regulation strategy, as opposed to a single enhancement, may be preferable for synergistically strengthening the organic acid fermentation and microbial activity during ensiling to achieve efficient biogas production.","Sun, H; Li, J; Cui, X; Stinner, W; Guo, JB; Dong, RJ",Ensiling; Pretreatment; Lignocellulose biomass; Acid-based hydrolysis; Biological degradation; Biogas production,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128826,Biological,anaerobic,ensilage,lignocellulose,corn,"leaves,stalks",,,,,,,,

Methane yield was increased by 13.8%, to 301 +/- 3 mL CH4/g VS, when lignocellulosic waste was pretreated with electrohydrolysis. A net energy gain of 13,224 kJ was realized after electrohydrolysis pretreatment, which was 1.51 times higher than reported for thermal pretreatment.

Enhancing biogas production from caribbean pelagic Sargassum utilising hydrothermal pretreatment and anaerobic co-digestion with food waste,"The recurring inundation of beaches in the tropical North Atlantic by pelagic Sargassum and the associated social, ecological and economic challenges, have aroused great interest in its potential use as a marine energy crop. However, to date, the seasonal availability and low experimental methane potential of these invasive brown seaweeds have hindered their commercial exploitation as feedstock for sustainable energy production. This novel study evaluated Caribbean pelagic Sargassum and the synergistic interactions of hydrothermal pretreatment and co-digestion with food waste at different mixture ratios, on biogas production enhancement and bio-fertiliser recovery. Batch testing revealed that hydrothermal pretreatment promoted the hydrolysis of organics in pelagic Sargassum and food waste, thus increasing methane recovery from mono-substrate digestion by 212.57% and 10.16%, respectively, in comparison to the untreated samples. Co-digestion of pelagic Sargassum and food waste redistributed metal elements and raised the buffering capacity of the digester, facilitating high organic loadings without pH control. Food waste also provided lipids to the seaweed feed which augmented the digestion performance. The maximum cumulative methane yield of 292.18 +/- 8.70 mL/gVS was obtained from a blend of co-pretreated pelagic Sargassum and food waste at the weight ratio 25:75. Screening of the whole digestate from co-digestion indicated bio-fertiliser potential. However, the solid fraction necessitates arsenic remediation to meet international soil standard guidelines. The findings of this study are promising and suggest opportunity for the design, scale up and optimisation of biogas systems, equipped with hydrothermal pretreatment for utilisation of Sargassum seaweeds during influx.

Thermal pretreatment and bioaugmentation improve methane yield of microalgal mix produced in thermophilic anaerobic digestate,"Liquid fraction produced in anaerobic digestion (AD) of biodegradable waste can be treated on-site with microalgae, which can be recycled back as substrate to the biogas plant. For this research, a pilot high rate algal pond (HRAP) was set with connections to a full scale biogas plant that enabled the use of waste heat and CO2 from a combined heat and power gen-set (CHP). The microalgal mix produced in the thermophilic anaerobic digestate supernatant was tested as a substrate for biogas production in the thermophilic AD (i.e. untreated, bioaugmented with anaerobic bacteria Clostridium thermocellum, and thermally pretreated, respectively). The methane potential of the untreated microalgal mix was low (157.5 +/- 18.7 mL CH4/g VS). However, after the thermal pretreatment of the microalgae, methane production increased by 62%, while in the bioaugmentation with C thermocellum under thermophilic conditions (T = 55 degrees C) it was elevated by 12%. The outcome of our pilot trial suggests that microalgae produced in the thermophilic biogas digestate represent a prospective alternative AD feedstock. At the same time, microalgae reduce the digestate nitrogen and COD to the level sufficient for the outflow to meet the quality required by the sewage system (ammonia-nitrogen max 200 mg/L, nitrite max 10 mg/L).

The methane potential of the untreated microalgal mix was low (157.5 +/- 18.7 mL CH4/g VS). However, after the thermal pretreatment of the microalgae, methane production increased by 62%, while in the bioaugmentation with C thermocellum under thermophilic conditions (T = 55 degrees C) it was elevated by 12%. The outcome of our pilot trial suggests that microalgae produced in the thermophilic biogas digestate represent a prospective alternative AD feedstock. At the same time, microalgae reduce the digestate nitrogen and COD to the level sufficient for the outflow to meet the quality required by the sewage system (ammonia-nitrogen max 200 mg/L, nitrite max 10 mg/L).

Production and characterization of enzymatic cocktail produced by Aspergillus niger using green macroalgae as nitrogen source and its application in the pre-treatment for biogas production from Ulva rigida,"Marine macroalgae are gaining more and more importance as a renewable feedstock for durable bioenergy production, but polysaccharides of this macroalgae are structurally complex in its chemical composition. The use of enzymatic hydrolysis may provide new pathways in the conversion of complex polysaccharides to fermentable sugars. In this study, an enzymatic cocktail with high specificity was first isolated from Aspergillus niger using the green macroalgae Ulva rigida as nitrogen source. The cocktail is rich on beta-glucosidase, pectinase and carboxy-methyl-cellulase ( CMCase). The highest activity was obtained with beta-glucosidase ( 109 IU mL (1)) and pectinase ( 76 IU mL (1)), while CMCase present the lowest activity 4.6 IU mL (1). The U. rigida pre-treatment with this enzymatic cocktail showed high rate of reduced sugar release, and could bring promising prospects for enzymatic pre-treatment of the biogas production from U. rigida biomass which reached 1175 mL g CODint1.

Influence of white-rot fungus Polyporus brumalis BRFM 985 culture conditions on the pretreatment efficiency for anaerobic digestion of wheat straw,"For the first time, Polyporus brumalis BRFM985 was cultivated on wheat straw to investigate the simultaneous effects of pretreatment parameters on anaerobic digestion: these include initial substrate humidity, temperature, duration, and metal supplementation. Surface response methodology was applied to quantify the importance of each parameter, as well as the synergistic effects between them. Firstly, metal addition and secondly, pretreatment duration, both resulted in a positive impact. According to calculations, the highest methane production (182 dm(3) of methane per kilogram of initial Total Solids) is associated to pretreatment with metal addition during 20 days.

Effect of rapid batch decompression on hydrolysate quality after hydrothermal pretreatment of wheat straw,"The subject of this paper was to study the effect of rapid batch decompression on hydrolysate quality and on biogas yield after the hydrothermal pretreatment of wheat straw. An aqueous batch containing 5 mass % total solids of wheat straw was thermally and thermally-expansionary treated in parallel at the process temperature of 170-200 degrees C and the residence time of 0-60 min. An analysis of the thermal and thermal-expansionary hydrolysate provided identical results in the dependences and values of chemical oxygen demand, acidities, and glucose yields of both treatments based on severity factors including the combined effects of temperature and residence time. Increases in the methane content of 33 % for thermally and of 34 % for thermally-expansionary treated wheat straw were reached in comparison to the methane yield from an untreated sample. This means that the polysaccharide cell wall was dissolved because of the high process temperature and residence time. From this it follows that all its nutrients were subsequently washed out of the cell into liquid where they caused changes in its chemical oxygen demand, glucose content, and acidities. There was therefore no rapid decompression effect on the hydrothermally treated wheat straw.

Enhanced biogas production from herbal-extraction process residues by microwave-assisted alkaline pretreatment,";BACKGROUND: Lignocellulosic wastes such as herbal-extraction process residues (HPR) are not easily utilized by microorganisms owing to their physical shielding of cellulose imparted by the non-digestible lignin. Therefore, there is a great interest to develop an efficient pretreatment technique to disrupt recalcitrant structures of lignocellulosic wastes and improve renewable energy production. RESULTS: A microwave-assisted alkaline pretreatment (MAP) method has been developed for the enhancement of biogas production from HPR. The maximum cumulative biogas production reached 1477 mL when the HPR was hydrolyzed by MAP for 30 min with an alkali loading of 0.12 g-NaOH/g-HPR, where the maximum weight loss of HPR after biogas fermentation reached 72.1%. CONCLUSION: The present work demonstrated that MAP is a promising method for improving bioconversion of lignocellulosic wastes to biogas. HPR pretreated by combining microwave irradiation and alkali resulted in releasing more soluble substances from HPR and increasing the accessibility of HPR for anaerobic biodigestion compared with traditional alkaline pretreatment (AP) and microwave-assisted water pretreatment (MWP).

White-Rot Fungi pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass for anaerobic digestion: Impact of glucose supplementation,"Anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic biomass is one of the most efficient ways to produce renewable energy. However, lignin contained in this biomass is difficult to hydrolyse. Pretreatment can help to overcome this limitation. Among them, low-cost fungal pretreatments seem noteworthy. Although widely used in pretreatment for bioethanol production, rot fungi have rarely been applied for improving biogas production during anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic biomass. The present study investigates the possibility to increase methane production from wheat straw pretreated with several fungal strains. After screening sixty-three strains, twelve preselected strains were used to pretreat straw. Compared to the control straw, up to 43% more methane per gram of, pretreated volatile solids were obtained with Poly-porus brumalis BRFM 985 strain. Taking into account the dry weight loss measured during pretreatment in non-optimized conditions, up to 21% more methane per gram of initial total solids was observed. Glucose addition during the pretreatment also proved to limit delignification and thus methane production from the substrate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Influence of temperature and pretreatments on the anaerobic digestion of wastewater grown microalgae in a laboratory-scale accumulatingvolume reactor,"This laboratory-scale study investigated the performance of a low-cost anaerobic digester for microalgae. Low (-2%) solids content wastewater-grown microalgal biomass (MB) was digested in an unmixed, accumulating-volume reactor (AVR) with solid and liquid separation that enabled a long solids retention time. AVRs (2 or 20 L) were operated at 20 degrees C, 37 degrees C or ambient temperature (8-21 degrees C), and the influence of two pretreatments lowtemperature thermal (50-57 degrees C) and freeze-thaw on algal digestion were studied. The highest methane yield from untreated MB was in the 37 degrees C AVR with 225 L CH4 kg volatile solids (VS)(-1), compared with 180 L CH4 kg VSadded-1 in a conventional, 37 degrees C completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR), and 101 L CH4 kg VSadded-1 in the 20 degrees C AVR. Freeze-thaw and low-temperature thermal pretreatments promoted protein hydrolysis and increased methane yields by 32-50% at 20 degrees C, compared with untreated MB. Pretreatments also increased the mineralisation of nitrogen (41-57%) and phosphorus (76-84%) during digestion.

Optimization of microwave pretreatment parameters of elephant grass by response surface methodology and kinetic study of its biomethanation,"The optimization of microwave pretreatment parameters of elephant grass and the kinetic study of biogas production from the pretreated feedstock were investigated. The elephant grass was characterized and pretreated in a microwave power system. The pretreatment parameters (energy and time) were optimized using response surface methodology. The pretreated elephant grass was decomposed by anaerobic digestion to produce biogas. The biogas compositions were determined using a digital gas analyzer, and the kinetics study was done using a first-order kinetic model. The results revealed that microwave pretreatment improved the inherent properties of the elephant grass, hence enhancing biogas yield. The optimum values of the parameters for the thermal pretreatment were resident time of 15 min and microwave irradiation energy of 72 kJ with the optimal average degree of disintegration of 35.88%. The biogas contains a reasonable amount of methane gas which contributed to its high calorific value of 21.32 MJ/m(3). The kinetic data for biogas production from microwave-pretreated elephant grass are a rate constant of 0.199 day(-1) and lag time of 2.5 days. Therefore, microwave pretreatment has the potential to remove lignin from lignocellulose biomasses and enhance biogas yield.","Ude, MU; Oluka, I",Biogas; elephant grass; microwave pretreatment; degree of disintegration; lignocellulose biomass; optimization,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17597269.2021.2002643,Physical,thermal,microwave,lignocellulose,elephant grass,plant,,,,,,,,
Mesophilic anaerobic digestion of pulp and paper industry biosludge-long-term reactor performance and effects of thermal pretreatment,"The pulp and paper industry wastewater treatment processes produce large volumes of biosludge. Limited anaerobic degradation of lignocellulose has hindered the utilization of biosludge, but the processing of biosludge using anaerobic digestion has recently regained interest. In this study, biosludge was used as a sole substrate in long-term (400 d) mesophilic laboratory reactor trials. Nine biosludge batches collected evenly over a period of one year from a pulp and paper industry wastewater treatment plant had different solid and nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus, trace elements) characteristics. Nutrient characteristics may vary by a factor of 2-11, while biomethane potentials (BMPs) ranged from 89 to 102 NL CH4 kg(-1) VS between batches. The BMPs were enhanced by 39-88% with thermal pretreatments at 105 -134 degrees C. Despite varying biosludge properties, stable operation was achieved in reactor trials with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 14 d. Hydrolysis was the process limiting step, ceasing gas production when the HRT was shortened to 10 days. However, digestion with an HRT of 10 days was feasible after thermal pretreatment of the biosludge (20 min at 121 degrees C) due to enhanced hydrolysis.

Effect of alkaline addition on anaerobic sludge digestion with combined pretreatment of alkaline and high pressure homogenization,"To improve anaerobic digestion efficiency, combination pretreatment of alkaline and high pressure homogenization was applied to pretreat sewage sludge. Effect of alkaline dosage on anaerobic sludge digestion was investigated in detail. SCOD of sludge supernatant significantly increased with the alkaline dosage increase after the combined pretreatment because of sludge disintegration. Organics were significantly degraded after the anaerobic digestion, and the maximal SCOD, TCOD and VS removal was 73.5%, 61.3% and 43.5%, respectively. Cumulative biogas production, methane content in biogas and biogas production rate obviously increased with the alkaline dosage increase. Considering both the biogas production and alkaline dosage, the optimal alkaline dosage was selected as 0.04 mol/L. Relationships between biogas production and sludge disintegration showed that the accumulative biogas was mainly enhanced by the sludge disintegration. The methane yield linearly increased with the DDCOD increase as Methane yield (ml/gVS) = 4.66 DDCOD - 9.69. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Full-Scale Assessment of Ultrasonic Sewage Sludge Pretreatment Using a Novel Double-Tube Reactor,"The performance of a novel double-tube ultrasound (US) reactor for waste activated sludge (WAS) pretreatment was assessed at a full-scale wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). For high transferability of the results, a well-performing WWTP with rather typical operating conditions was selected. The effects of the treatment (conducted at a specific energy input of 200 kJ per kg of total solids) were monitored regarding improvements in sludge viscosity, methane production, biosolids removal, and digestate dewaterability. The pretreatment caused a significant reduction of WAS viscosity (-5.8% on average, at p < 0.01) and a maximum yet insignificant increase in methane yield (+6.2%, at p < 0.1). No effect was observed for solids content, viscosity, or dewaterability of the digestate. The economic benefit of the reduced WAS viscosity was negligible, as the reduced pumping costs were less than 1 parts per thousand of the US reactor's electricity costs. Additional methane yields enabled for partial cost recovery (roughly equivalent to the energy costs), while investment costs of the US equipment could not be regained. Yet, the incorporation of improved methane production in the economic assessment remains somewhat speculative, given the only insignificant increase. Results suggest that an economical application of ultrasonic WAS pretreatment is challenging for typical, well-performing WWTPs.","Lippert, T; Bandelin, J; Vogl, D; Tesieh, ZA; Wild, T; Drewes, JE; Koch, K",Ultrasound pretreatment; sewage sludge; biogas production; sludge viscosity; full-scale assessment,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsestengg.0c00138,Physical,ultrasonic,,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Biogas Productivity Potential of Agricultural Residue Straw as Mono-fermentation Substrate,"The object of this study is to provide the scientific basis of biogas industry with agricultural residue straws as energy biomass. The biogas productivity potential experiment and reactor amplification experiment are carried out to study biogas yield from different agricultural straws including wheat straw, corn straw, peanut straw, soybean straw as well as rice straw, and the relationship between biogas yield and the anaerobic reactor volume with wheat straw as the substrate and with biogas slurry as a source of microorganisms under room temperature conditions (35 degrees C). Micro-aerobic pretreatment fermentation technology is used to treat the agricultural straws. The batch anaerobic digestion technology and drainage collection process are used. The results show that the order of biogas yield from high to low is wheat, rice, corn, peanut and soybean straw.

Production of biogas by microorganisms with saccharine sorghum straw as substrate with or without alkaline and citric pretreatment,"This study proposes the use of mixtures of straws with different pretreatments (citric acid or NaOH: urea) and straw in natura, in anaerobic biodigestion. As this straw is a lignocellulosic material with slow degradation by microorganisms, it is necessary to apply pretreatments, increasing biogas production and consumption of volatile solids. The pretreated material can be used to increase the solids content in anaerobic biodigestion reactors operating with large volumes and low volatile solids loads. This study showed a synergistic effect between substrates with different pretreatments and found the best blend for each hydraulic retention time. The ideal mix up to 31 days of hydraulic retention time was from 33.33% to 50.00% of straw pretreated with NaOH: urea and the remainder with straw pretreated with citric acid. After this period, at 46 days, mixtures containing all three components are desirable. At 61 days, factors such as volatile solids reduction and methane content were no longer significant, with a mixture of straw pretreated with citric acid and NaOH: urea at 50% each.

Enhancement of biogas production in anaerobic co-digestion by ultrasonic pretreatment,"This paper optimized the anaerobic digestion (AD) pretreatment process and identified the influence of pretreatment on the co-digestion of maize straw (MS) and dairy manure (DM). In the study, ultrasonic was used to pretreat MS and DM prior to digestion, with power intensities of 0, 189.39, 284.09, and 378.79 kJ at 0, 20, 30, and 40 min, respectively. Changes in the surface structures of MS and DM were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and factor analysis was used to analyze the main factors affecting biogas production in the AD process. The result showed that the structure of DM was distributed and that the structure of MS became more roughness following the ultrasonic pretreatment (UP). The highest total biogas production of co-digestion (240.32 mL/g VSfed) was obtained when MS was pretreated for 30 min without DM pretreatment (MS30DM0). This was significantly higher than that of the untreated sample (CK) (141.65 mL/g VSfed). The cellulose activity (CA), reducing sugar (RS) content, volatile fatty acid (VFA) content and pH in the digester feed, and their maximum and minimum values in the AD process was affected by UP. Factor 1 of MS30DM0 was determined by RS content, pH and VFA content that they had the most influence on biogas production on days 6, 18, 24 and 30. Factor 2 of it was determined by CA, and it had most influence on days 0, 12, 36 and 42 in the AD process, The result of the factor analysis indicated that the main factors affecting biogas production were affected by UP and they differ according to the different digestion stages. This research concluded that UP improved total biogas production via changing the initial environment of AD and the environment during AD process, the changes made the environment more suitable for AD.

INTEGRATED PRODUCTION OF BIOFUELS AND SUCCINIC ACID FROM BIOMASS AFTER THERMOCHEMICAL PRETREATMENTS,"The aim of this study was to develop an effective thermochemical method for treatment of industrial hemp, in order to increase its bioconversion to biofuels and bio-products. Industrial hemp was subjected to various thermochemical pretreatments using: alkaline (3 % NaOH), oxidative (3 % H2O2 at pH 11.5) and glycerol-based methods (70-90 % of glycerol, 1-3 % NaOH), prior to enzymatic hydrolysis with Cellic (R) CTec2/Cellic (R) HTec2 (15 FPU.g(-1) glucan).

Wet air oxidation as a pretreatment option for selective biodegradability enhancement and biogas generation potential from complex effluent,"This study looks at the possibility of wet air oxidation (WAO) based pretreatment of complex effluent to selectively enhance the biodegradability (without substantial COD destruction) and facilitate biogas generation potential. A lab-scale wet air oxidation reactor with biomethanated distillery wastewater (B-DWW) as a model complex effluent (COD 40,000 mg L-1) was used to demonstrate the proof-of-concept. The studies were conducted using a designed set of experiments and reaction temperature (150-200 degrees C), air pressure (6-12 bar) and reaction time (15-120 min) were the main process variables of concern for WAO process optimization. WAO pretreatment of B-DWW enhanced the biodegradability of the complex wastewater by the virtue of enhancing its biodegradability index (BI) from 0.2 to 0.88, which indicate favorable Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP) for biogas generation. The kinetics of COD destruction and BI enhancement has also been reported. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Mechanical pretreatment for increased biogas production from lignocellulosic biomass; predicting the methane yield from structural plant components,"Lignocellulosic substrates are associated with limited biodegradability due to the structural complexity. For that reason, a pretreatment step is mandatory for efficient biomass transformation which will lead to increased bioenergy output. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficiency of two pretreatment machines to enhance the methane yield of meadow grass. Specifically, the application of shearing forces with a rotated plastic sweeping brush against a steel roller significantly increased biomass biodegradability by 20% under relatively gentle operation conditions (600 rpm). The more intense operation (1200 rpm) was not associated with higher methane yield enhancement. Regarding an alternative machine, in which the brush was replaced with a coarse steel roller resulted in a more distinct effect (+27%) despite the lower rotating speed (similar to 400 rpm). Moreover, the association of the substrate's individual chemical components and the practical methane yield was assessed, establishing single and multiple linear regression models. However, the estimation accuracy was rather low with either single (regressor: lignin, R-2: 0.50) or multiple linear regression analyses (regressors: arabinan-lignin-protein, R-2: 0.61). Results showed that poorly lignified plant tissue containing relatively high fractions of protein and arabinan is more susceptible to anaerobic digestion. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Effect of pretreatments on cellulosic composition and morphology of pine needle for possible utilization as substrate for anaerobic digestion,"Waste residues from agricultural and forest resources have received much attention as potential source of lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) especially after the food-versus-fuel conflict. Therefore, exploring the potential of LCB (especially forest biomass) as a resource for sustainable bioenergy generation is highly promising. The present study reports the structural modification in the cross-linking of lignocellulosic complex in pine needle forest biomass after pretreatments: milling, steam explosion and acid-base-acid treatments. The changes in morphology and composition of the cellulose and lignin in pine needles after pretreatments was evaluated using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy, Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Field Emission Scanning Electron micrographs revealed that pretreatments resulted in changes in orderly arrangement of interwoven fibrils, surface abnormalities in cells surrounding stomatal opening and exposure of vascular bundle. FT-IR of pretreated substrate indicated significant changes in functional moieties of ester bond between lignin and hemicelluloses, phenol hydroxyl moieties and aromatic ring associated with lignin and hydrogen bonding in cellulose. The findings in the present study thus open up avenues for exploring potential of pretreated pine needles for renewable bioenergy generation. Anaerobic digestion (AD) of the pretreated biomass resulted in 21.4% higher methane levels as compared to untreated pine litter. Appearance of lignin droplets and deposition of coalescent materials on pre-treated biomass surface was also observed in the present study.

"Pretreatment of non-sterile, rotted silage maize straw by the microbial community MC1 increases biogas production","Using microbial community MC1 to pretreat lignocellulosic materials increased the yield of biogas production, and the substrate did not need to be sterilized, lowering the cost. Rotted silage maize straw carries many microbes. To determine whether such contamination affects MC1, rotted silage maize straw was pretreated with MC1 prior to biogas production. The decreases in the weights of unsterilized and sterilized rotted silage maize straw were similar, as were their carboxymethyl cellulase activities. After 5 d pretreatment, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction results indicated that the proportions of five key strains in MC1 were the same in the unsterilized and sterilized groups; thus, MC1 was resistant to microbial contamination. However, its resistance to contamination decreased as the degradation time increased. Following pretreatment, volatile fatty acids, especially acetic acid, were detected, and MC1 enhanced biogas yields by 74.7% compared with the untreated group.

Effect of Pretreatment of Traditional Chinese Medicine Residue on the Biogas Productivity,"The object of this study is to open the new ways of exploitation and utilization of traditional Chinese medicine residue (TCMR) as new energy material to produce biogas through indoor simulation tests. The experiment is carried out to study the effect of physical pretreatment by crusher on the biogas productivity of TCMR under medium temperature condition (35 degrees C). TCMR is used as signal fermentation material without foreign elements which is 5% and cow dung is 10% for inoculum. The batch anaerobic digestion technology and the drainage collection biogas method are used. The results show that there is similar total biogas yield between the smashed TCMR and the unsmashed TCMR, of which the former is 9.35 L and the later is 9.28 L during 51 days fermentation. The biogas yield of smashed TCMR is higher than that of TCMR during fermentation starting period, and lower at the later stage. The results suggest that TCMR could be regarded as biogas fermentation material, and should not be smashed in order to economize the production cost.","Li, YY; Gao, WL; Du, MH; Li, J; Cui, ZJ; Cheng, X",Biogas productivity; Traditional Chinese medicine residue; Physical pretreatment method; Physico-chemical characteristics,2011,http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.335-336.1499,Physical,mechanical desintegration,crushing,lignocellulose,herbal,residue,,,,,,,,
Acidogenic biorefinery of rice straw for volatile fatty acids production via sequential two-stage fermentation: Effects of pre-treatments,"The physical and chemical effects of the hydrothermal, acid and alkali pretreatment methods of rice straw were investigated to be used in volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production through two-stage anaerobic fermentation. The effects of two-stage acid production and fermentation process parameters of different pretreated straws under the fermentation temperature conditions of 35 degrees C, 55 degrees C, and 70 degrees C were analyzed. The results showed that The hydrothermal, 2% HCl, and 1% Ca(OH)(2) increased the specific surface area of the rice straw by 12.20%, 52.62% and 37.81%, respectively. The alkali pretreatment increased the macro and mesopores of the rice straw while the hydrothermal and acid pretreatments increased the small and micropores. The primary fermentation did not affect significantly the infrared spectrum peaks of pretreated rice straw. The rate and total VFAs production was enhanced significantly after the 1% Ca(OH)(2) pretreatment compared with 2%HCl and hydrothermal pretreatments respectively.

Steam-explosion pretreatment for enhancing anaerobic digestion of municipal wastewater sludge,"This study evaluated the use of steam explosion as a pretreatment for municipal wastewater treatment sludges and biosolids as a technique for enhancing biogas generation during anaerobic digestion. Samples of dewatered anaerobic digester effluent (biosolids) and a mixture of thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS) and biosolids were steam-exploded under differing levels of intensity in this study. The results indicate that steam explosion can solublize components of these sludge streams., Increasing the intensity of the steam-explosion pressure and temperature resulted in increased solublization. The steam-explosion pretreatment also increased the bioavailability of sludge components under anaerobic digestion conditions. Increasing the steam-explosion intensity increased the ultimate yield of methane during anaerobic digestion. Batch anaerobic digestion tests suggested that pretreatment at 300 psi was the most optimal condition for enhanced biogas generation while minimizing energy input. Semicontinuous anaerobic digestion revealed that the results that were observed in the batch tests were sustainable in prolonged operation. Semicontinuous digestion of the TWAS/biosolids mixture that was pretreated at 300 psi generated approximately 50% more biogas than the controls. Semicontinuous digestion of the pretreated biosolids resulted in a 3-fold increase in biogas compared with the controls. Based on capillary suction test results, steam-explosion pretreatment at 300 psi improved the dewaterability of the final digested sludge by 32 and 45% for the TWAS/ biosolids mixture and biosolids, respectively, compared with controls. The energy requirements of the nonoptimized steam-explosion process were substantially higher than the additional energy produced from enhanced digestion of the pretreated sludge. Substantial improvements in energy, efficiency will be required to make the process viable from an energy perspective.","Dereix, M; Parker, W; Kennedy, K",anaerobic sludge digestion; pretreatment; steam explosion; thickened waste activated sludge; biosolids; biogas,2006,http://dx.doi.org/10.2175/106143006X95456,Physical,thermal,steam explosion,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
The impact of thermal pretreatment on various solid-liquid ratios of palm oil mill effluent (POME) for enhanced thermophilic anaerobic digestion performance,"An advancement to the treatment process of palm oil mill effluent (POME) was proposed whereby a pretreatment technology and a dewatering device are introduced into the existing treatment process. Thermal pretreatment is a robust technique with the ability to enhance the rate and increase the biogas production of anaerobic digestion. The dewatering device will confer a means of control on the digester's load, allowing the removal of microbes and impurities as well as assist in the residual oil removal. The proposed advancement to the treatment process allows the removal of cooling ponds making the treatment process more sustainable in terms of the substantial reduction in the amount of greenhouse gas emission, improved residual oil removal efficiency in the waste stream, and better treated effluent quality. However, to be able to implement this innovative treatment method effectively, it is fundamental to know how thermal pretreatment undertook on the solid content of POME impacts on the anaerobic digestion process performance. To conduct the study mentioned above, POME was pretreated at 120 degrees C and was allowed to settle to separate the settled suspension and the clear liquor phases (hereafter denoted solid as S and liquid as L). Batch thermophilic anaerobic digestion was conducted on various solid: liquid ratios (i.e., the 205:80L, 405:60L, 505:50L, 755:25L, and 100S). It was found that the optimal ratios were 205:80L and 40S:60L, which generated approximately 9-fold and 6-fold higher methane yield, respectively, in contrast to their untreated counterparts. Thermally pretreated 40S:60L solid loading exhibited a higher removal efficiency in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil & grease (O&G), a higher methane yield of 328 mL CH4/g CODremoved and biogas production of 1886 +/- 21 mL from a working volume of 100 mL compared to all the other pretreated and untreated ratios.

Liquid Hot Water Pretreatment of Paddy Straw for Enhanced Biomethanation,"Indian agriculture produces nearly 150-160 million tons of paddy straw per annum. 70-80 % of total produced rice straw is burned in the open field for cultivation of the next crop. Proper disposal of paddy straw in an economical and environment friendly manner is a serious concern in India, where rice is the major agricultural crop in some states. The work presented in the paper is focused on pretreatment of paddy straw using liquid hot water treatment followed by biomethanation. Results observed during batch process are encouraging and work is being carried out for bigger models. Under batch condition with similar to 5-7 kg of paddy straw can yield 1.0 m(3) of biogas with average methane content of 60.0 and 25-30 % carbon dioxide content during retention period of 40 days.","Trivedi, A; Vijay, VK; Chandra, R",Agricultural residue; Lignocellulosic biomass; Biomass pretreatment; Liquid hot water pretreatment; Biogas from paddy straw; Biomethane production,2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-81-322-2773-1_2,Physical,thermal,liquid hot water,lignocellulose,rice,straw,,,,,,,,

Acid hydrolysis was successfully triggered with 0.2 M industry-grade HCl at 80 degrees C for a 2 h period, increasing biomethane recovery by +39%, with a maximum BMP of 121 mLg(-1) volatile solids (VS). To reduce the necessity for input material, HCl was replaced by the acidic waste product flue gas condensate (FGC). Improved performance was achieved by showing an increase in biomethane recovery of +24% and a maximum BMP of 108 mLg(-1) VS. Continuous anaerobic digestion trials of RM were conducted for three hydraulic retention times, showing the feasibility of monodigestion. The biomethane recovery was 60 mL and 65 mLg(-1) VSd(-1) for thermophilic and mesophilic operation, respectively.

Evaluation of Steam Explosion Pretreatment and Enzymatic Hydrolysis Conditions for Agave Bagasse in Biomethane Production,"The production of biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass includes a pretreatment step to alter the biomass structure and facilitate the enzymatic degradation of the polymers to obtain assimilable compounds. In this study, agave bagasse (AB) was used as a feedstock for obtaining methane, for which AB was pretreated with steam explosion and enzymatically hydrolyzed. The pretreatment conditions corresponded to severity factors (SFs) within a range from 1.65 to 2.89, while enzymatic hydrolysis was performed with enzyme loads of Cellic CTec2 within a range from 0.12 to 3.6 mg(protein) g(AB)(-1).

Impacts of Chemical-Assisted Thermal Pretreatments on Methane Production from Fruit and Vegetable Harvesting Wastes: Process Optimization,"The increasing population creates excess pressure on the plantation and production of fruits and vegetables across the world. Consumption demand during the whole year has made production compulsory in the covered production system (greenhouse). Production, harvesting, processing, transporting, and distribution chains of fruit and vegetables have resulted in a huge amount of wastes as an alternative source to produce biofuels. In this study, optimization of two pretreatment processes (NaOH and HCl assisted thermal) was investigated to enhance methane production from fruit and vegetable harvesting wastes (FVHW) that originate from greenhouses. NaOH concentration (0-6.5%), HCl concentration (0-5%), reaction temperature (60-100 degrees C), solid content (1-5%), time of reaction (1-5 h), and mixing speed (0-500 rpm) were chosen in a wide range of levels to optimize the process in a broad design boundary and to evaluate the positive and negative impacts of independent variables along with their ranges. Increasing NaOH and HCl concentrations resulted in higher COD solubilization but decreased the concentration of soluble sugars that can be converted directly into methane. Thus, the increasing concentrations of NaOH and HCl in the pretreatments have resulted in low methane production. The most important independent variables impacting COD and sugar solubilization were found to be chemical concentration (as NaOH and HCl), solid content and reaction temperature for the optimization of pretreatment processes. The high amount of methane productions in the range of 222-365 mL CH4 gVS(-1) was obtained by the simple thermal application without using chemical agents as NaOH or HCl.

Effects of Oil Extraction on Ethanol and Biogas Production from Eruca sativa Seed Cake,"Ethanol and biogas are promising alternative fuels that can be produced from inedible agricultural wastes. However, a pretreatment step is needed to make these substrates amenable to the microbial digestion. The residue of vegetable oil extraction process, called seed cake, offers potential as a feedstock for ethanol and biogas production. However, the oil extraction process may affect the performance of further processes. In this study, the effect of mechanical and solvent extraction methods of Eruca sativa grains was studied on the further ethanol and biogas production from its seed cake. The mechanically extracted seed cake (MESC) and solvent extracted seed cake (SESC) were subjected to NaOH pretreatment prior to ethanolic fermentation and anaerobic digestion. The pretreatment offered positive effects on glucose and ethanol production yield from both type of seed cake; however, the results were more promising on MESC, in which the yield improved by 301.7 %. In case of biogas production, the pretreatment substantially increased the methane production from the MESC by 105.6 %, while it showed negative effects on the SESC. The current study suggested that the oil extraction method can affect the performance of further processes on seed cake for biofuel production, especially biogas.","Bateni, H; Bateni, F; Karimi, K",Alkaline pretreatment; Biogas; Ethanol; Mechanically extracted seed cake; Solvent extracted seed cake,2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-016-9731-x,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,lignocellulose,eruca sative,seed cake,,,,,,,,
Pyrolysis-GC-MS to assess the fungal pretreatment efficiency for wheat straw anaerobic digestion,"Cost-effective and environment-friendly pretreatments, such as fungal pretreatments, are required for anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic biomass particularly because the amount of methane produced is often limited by the lignin content. Anaerobic digestibility is estimated using a Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP) test, which lasts several weeks. Since the Py-GC MS technique is considered to be a rapid method for obtaining information on various organic components, its suitability for the study of fungal pretreatment efficiency in anaerobic digestion was investigated here, to our knowledge for the first time. In this goal, mycelium of the white-rot fungi Polyporus brumalis BRFM 985, untreated wheat straw and straw pretreated with different fungal strains and under different conditions were analysed with PyGC MS. In the mycelium pyrolysate, diverse compounds, often considered as unspecific, probably derive from proteins (toluene, etc.). A strong presence of tyrosine and phenylalanine among the fungus amino acids was also suspected. As for pretreated straw samples, a correlation was observed between the amount of fungal biomass determined by qPCR (used as a reference method) and the sum of relative areas of toluene, styrene and ethylbenzene in the pyrograms, showing that it is feasible to estimate the fungal biomass amount on pretreated straws using Py-GC MS. In addition, the H/L-Py (Holocelluloses/Lignin) ratio, determined by dividing the sums of areas of pyrolysis compounds that have a polysaccharide (PS) and lignin (LIG) origin, was correlated to the BMP values of pretreated straws, thus showing that the pretreatment efficiency can be rapidly estimated with Py-GC MS in the tested conditions.

Techno-economical study of ethanol and biogas from spruce wood by NMMO-pretreatment and rapid fermentation and digestion,"Given that N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) is a promising alternative for the pretreatment of lignocelluloses, a novel process for ethanol and biogas production from wood was developed. The solvent, NMMO, is concentrated by multistage evaporation, and the wood is pretreated with the concentrated NMMO. Thereafter, ethanol is produced by the non-isothermal simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (NSSF) method, which is a rapid and efficient process. The wastewater is treated by upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) digester for rapid production of biogas. The process was simulated by Aspen plus (R). Using mechanical vapor recompression for evaporators in the pretreatment and multi-pressure distillation columns, the energy requirements for the process were minimized. The economical feasibility of the developed biorefinery for five different plant capacities was studied by Aspen Icarus Process Evaluator. The base case was designed to utilize 200,000 tons of spruce wood per year and required ME 58.3 as the total capital investment, while the production cost of ethanol is calculated to be (sic)/1 0.44.

Alkaline Pretreatments for Sorghum and Miscanthus Anaerobic Digestion: Impacts at Cell Wall and Tissue Scales,"Lignocellulosic biomass is hardly degraded during anaerobic digestion. Among a large panel of pretreatments used to improve the biodegradability of this substrate, alkaline pretreatments are recognized as the most efficient to remove lignin and therefore improve the methane production of these substrates. This article uses different histological stains (FASGA, phloroglucinol, Maule reagent, Congo red), immunolocalization, and histological quantification on pretreated internode stem tissue section in order to decipher the mechanism of alkaline pretreatment action (CaO and NaOH) in the anatomical and lignocellulosic matrix scale of Sorghum Biomass 140 hybrid and of Miscanthus x giganteus Floridulus. A significant delignification of all tissues was observed (sclerenchyma, parenchyma, and xylem) except in the epidermis and in the internal part of the perivascular sclerenchyma. The degradation of lignin under the effect of alkaline pretreatment is accompanied by a massive unmasking of cellulose and a reduction of crystalline cellulose. This induced an increase of anaerobic digestion kinetics for both biomass and of methane yield for miscanthus. Miscanthus is rich in G-type lignins located mainly at the level of the perivascular sclerenchyma of the external internode zone which was more degraded by alkalies than the S-type lignin; this may explain the improvement of miscanthus methane potential.","Thomas, HL; Nolasco, HFP; Carrere, H; Lartaud, M; Cao, TV; Baptiste, C; Verdeil, JL",Alkaline pretreatments; Lignocellulosic biomass; Biogas; Histochemistry; Tissue structure; Cell wall macromolecules mapping,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-021-10342-9,Chemical,alkaline,"naoh,cao",lignocellulose,sorghum,plant,,,,,,,,

"Integrated Process for Ethanol, Biogas, and Edible Filamentous Fungi-Based Animal Feed Production from Dilute Phosphoric Acid-Pretreated Wheat Straw","Integration of wheat straw for a biorefinery-based energy generation process by producing ethanol and biogas together with the production of high-protein fungal biomass (suitable for feed application) was the main focus of the present study. An edible ascomycete fungal strain Neurospora intermedia was used for the ethanol fermentation and subsequent biomass production from dilute phosphoric acid (0.7 to 1.2% w/v) pretreated wheat straw. At optimum pretreatment conditions, an ethanol yield of 84 to 90% of the theoretical maximum, based on glucan content of substrate straw, was observed from fungal fermentation post the enzymatic hydrolysis process. The biogas production from the pretreated straw slurry showed an improved methane yield potential up to 162% increase, as compared to that of the untreated straw. Additional biogas production, using the syrup, a waste stream obtained post the ethanol fermentation, resulted in a combined total energy output of 15.8 MJ/kg wheat straw. Moreover, using thin stillage (a waste stream from the first-generation wheat-based ethanol process) as a co-substrate to the biogas process resulted in an additional increase by about 14 to 27% in the total energy output as compared to using only wheat straw-based substrates.","Nair, RB; Kabir, MM; Lennartsson, PR; Taherzadeh, MJ; Horvath, IS",Wheat straw; Dilute acid pretreatment; Filamentous fungi; Bioethanol; Biogas; Integration; N. intermedia,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-017-2525-1,Chemical,acidic,h3p04,lignocellulose,wheat,straw,,,,,,,,
AMMONOX: Ammonia for Enhancing Biogas Yield and Reducing NOx-Analysis of Effects of Aqueous Ammonia Soaking on Manure Fibers,"Laboratory experiments have shown that aqueous ammonia soaking (AAS) is a promising treatment for increasing the methane yield of the solid fraction of manure (fibers). AMMONOX is a new concept based on the sustainable use of ammonia for enhancing biogas production at biogas plants digesting manure. The proposed process is based on an optimized AAS treatment of manure fibers in combination with an efficient ammonia recovery step. The enhancement of biogas production is achieved by enriching manure with AAS-treated fibers, or other lignocellulosic residues, while the ammonia recovered can be used for fulfilling the needs of the treatment itself. Excess of ammonia could be produced when ammonia is recovered from both the treated fibers and the digester effluent, which could be used for the reduction of NOx in biogas-based electricity generation by gas turbines. In this survey study, the importance of different factors affecting the performance of AAS of digested manure fibers was investigated in order to conclude on which variables to optimize. Principal component analysis of the present data was used for a preliminary analysis of effects. The temperature and the ammonia concentration during AAS were the most influencing variables in terms of methane yield under the conditions tested. Further experiments should be conducted in order to investigate the effect of shorter AAS duration than the ones tested (lower than 24 h) and for assessing the importance of the solid-to-liquid ratio in the treatment mixture; the follow-up campaign should be optimized with respect to possible interactions/correlated experimental factor effects.","Lymperatou, A; Gavala, HN; Esbensen, KH; Skiadas, IV",Biogas; Pretreatment; Aqueous ammonia soaking; Methane yield; Manure fibers; Principal component analysis,2015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-015-9365-4,Chemical,alkaline,aqueous ammonia soaking AMMONOX,manure,swine,,,,,,,,,
Methane production potential from anaerobic co-digestions of different animal dungs and sweet corn residuals,"The sweet corn planted areas in Thailand are estimated more than 2.8 million acres and they are also likely to increase by an average about 0.9% each year. These lead to increase the amounts of sweet corn residuals such as trees, leaves, cobs and husks, are accumulated into the fields for burning management more than 35,000 tons per year. The renewable energy production by using biogas technology should be instead of burning for treatment of sweet corn residuals. Seeds, corncobs and cornhusks were used as materials for dry anaerobic digestion using co-digestion technology with 3 types of dung; pig dung, cow dung and goat dung. Corncobs and cornhusk were grinded into 2-3 cm of length and pretreated with alkali pretreatment at room temperature for 48 hr. After pretreatment, hemicellulose and lignin were reduced form original plants by using 2%(w/v) of NaOH. The digestions were performed at 1:1 of dung and corn residual ratio, at 37 +/- 2 degrees C, 74 +/- 3% humidity, 25% of initial total solid, and C/N ratio at 3-10:1. The results showed that anaerobic co-digestion between pig dung/seed (PS), goat dung/husk (GH) and cow dung/husk (CH) showed the highest efficiency of COD removal at 79.80%, 74.37% and 72.49%, respectively. While GH, goat dung/cob (GC), and PS had maximum biochemical methane potential at 68.20%, 60.58% and 24.11%, respectively. Moreover, GH had highest methane concentration at 46 vol%, and also produced the volume of methane at 5,045.8 ml/gVS. These values were equivalent to heating value at 16.53 MJ/m(3). Meanwhile pig dung/seed (PS) and cow dung/cob (CC) had methane concentration at 19 vol% and 9.10 vol%, respectively. However, the amount of H2S at 30 day of dry digestion using pig dung, cow dung and goat dung were equal to 160 ppm, 58.33 ppm and 25 ppm, respectively. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Progress in the production of biogas from Virginia mallow after alkaline-heat pretreatment,"This study aimed to analyze the coupled effect of electromagnetic microwave radiation and sodium hydroxide on the structure of a lignocellulosic complex of Virginia mallow and to determine the susceptibility of the pretreated substrate to anaerobic degradation.

NaOH dose increase from 0.02 g.g(t.s)(-1). to 0.2 g.g(t.s)(-1). caused biogas production to increase in both heating variants. In turn, NaOH dose increase to 0.4 g.g(t.s)(-1). resulted in diminished biogas production in variants with both microwave and conventional heating, i.e. by 15.3% and 20.8%, respectively.

Optimization strategies for improved biogas production by recycling of waste through response surface methodology and artificial neural network: Sustainable energy perspective research,"Objective: The primary aim of the study is to augment the biogas production from flower waste through optimization and pretreatment techniques. Methods: Enhancement of biogas production by using response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) was done. The time for agitation, the concentration of the substrate, temperature and pH were considered as model variables to develop the predictive models. Pretreatment of withered flowers was studied by using physical, chemical, hydrothermal and biological methods. Results: The linear model terms of concentration of substrate, temperature, pH, and time for agitation had effects of interaction (p < 0.05) significantly.

Pretreatment of oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) by N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) for biogas production: Structural changes and digestion improvement,"Pretreatment of OPEFB (oil palm empty fruit bunch) by NMMO (N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide) on its subsequent digestions was investigated. The pretreatments were carried out at 90 and 120 degrees C for 1, 3, and 5 h in three different modes of dissolution (by 85% NMMO solution), ballooning (79% NMMO solution), and swelling (73% NMMO solution). The total solid recovery after the pretreatment was 89-94%. The pretreatment process did not have a major impact on the composition of OPEFB, other than a reduction of ash from 5.4% up to 1.3%. The best improvement in biogas production was achieved by a dissolution mode pretreatment of OPEFB, using conditions of 85% NMMO, 3 h, and 120 degrees C. It resulted in 0.408 Nm(3)/kg VS methane yield and 0.032 Nm(3) CH4/kg VS/day initial methane production rate, which correspond in improving by 48% and 167% compared to the untreated OPEFB, respectively.

"Agave tequilana bagasse for methane production in batch and sequencing batch reactors: Acid catalyst effect, batch optimization and stability of the semi-continuous process","Agave tequilana bagasse is the main solid waste of the tequila manufacturing and represents an environmental issue as well as a potential feedstock for biofuel production due to its lignocellulosic composition and abundance. In this contribution, this feedstock was subjected to pretreatments with HCl and H2SO4 for sugar recovery and methane was produced from the hydrolysates in batch and sequencing batch reactors (AnSBR). Sugar recovery was optimized by using central composite designs at different levels of temperature, acid concentration and hydrolysis time. Results showed that at optimal conditions, the HCl pretreatment induced higher sugar recoveries than the H2SO4 one, 0.39 vs. 0.26 g total sugars/g bagasse. Furthermore, the H2SO4 hydrolysate contained higher concentrations of potential inhibitory compounds (furans and acetic acid). Subsequent anaerobic batch assays demonstrated that the HCl hydrolysate is a more suitable substrate for methane production; a fourfold increase was found. A second optimization by using HCl as add catalyst and methane production as the response variable demonstrated that softer hydrolysis conditions are required to optimize methane production as compared to sugar recovery (1.8% HCl, 119 degrees C and 103min vs. 1.9% HCl, 130 degrees C and 133min). This softer conditions were used to feed an AnSBR for 110 days and evaluate its stability at three different cycle times (5, 3 and 2 days). Results showed stable reactor performances at cycle times of 5 and 3 days, obtaining the highest methane yield and production at 3 days, 0.28 NL CH4/g-COD and 1.04 NL CH4/d respectively. Operation at shorter cycle times is not advised due to microbial imbalance.","Breton-Deval, L; Mendez-Acosta, HO; Gonzalez-Alvarez, V; Snell-Castro, R; Gutierrez-Sanchez, D; Arreola-Vargas, J",Acid hydrolysis; Biogas; Biomass pretreatment; Central composite design; Lignocellulosic biomass; Response surface methodology,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.07.053,Chemical,acidic,"hcl,h2so4",lignocellulose,Agave tequilana,bagasse,,,,,,56,11,17.5
Biogas production from Pongamia biomass wastes and a model to estimate biodegradability from their composition,"In this study, I investigated the chemical characteristics, biochemical methane potential, conversion kinetics and biodegradability of untreated and NaOH-treated Pongamia plant parts, and pod husk and press cake from the biodiesel industry to evaluate their suitability as an alternative feedstock for biogas production. The untreated Pongamia seeds exhibited the maximum CH4 yield of 473 ml g (-1) volatile solid (VS) added. Yellow, withered leaves gave a yield as low as 122 ml CH4 g (-1) VS added. There were significant variations in the CH4 production rate constants, which ranged from 0.02 to 0.15 d (-1), and biodegradability, which ranged from 0.25 to 0.98. NaOH treatment of leaf and pod husk, which were highly rich in fibers, increased the yields by 15-22% and CH4 production rate constants by 20-75%. Utilization of Pongamia wastes in biogas digesters not only influences the economics of biodiesel production but also yields CH4 fuel and protects the environment. The experimental data from this study were used to develop a multiple regression model, which could estimate biodegradability based on biochemical characteristics. The model predicted the biodegradability of previously published biomass wastes (r(2) = 0.88) from their biochemical composition. The theoretical CH4 yields estimated as 350 ml g(-1) chemical oxygen demand destroyed are much higher than the experimental yields as 100% biodegradability is assumed for each substrate. Upon correcting the theoretical CH4 yields with biodegradability data obtained from chemical analyses of substrates, their ultimate CH4 yields could be predicted rapidly.","Gunaseelan, VN",Biochemical methane potential assay; Pongamia biomass; biodegradability; NaOH pretreatment; regression model; biogas yield,2014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0734242X13517417,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,lignocellulose,pongamia,cake,,,,,,,,
Anaerobic Digestion of Laminaria japonica Waste from Industrial Production Residues in Laboratory- and Pilot-Scale,"The cultivation of macroalgae to supply the biofuel, pharmaceutical or food industries generates a considerable amount of organic residue, which represents a potential substrate for biomethanation. Its use optimizes the total resource exploitation by the simultaneous disposal of waste biomaterials. In this study, we explored the biochemical methane potential (BMP) and biomethane recovery of industrial Laminaria japonica waste (LJW) in batch, continuous laboratory and pilot-scale trials. Thermo-acidic pretreatment with industry-grade HCl or industrial flue gas condensate (FGC), as well as a co-digestion approach with maize silage (MS) did not improve the biomethane recovery. BMPs between 172 mL and 214 mL g(-1) volatile solids (VS) were recorded. We proved the feasibility of long-term continuous anaerobic digestion with LJW as sole feedstock showing a steady biomethane production rate of 173 mL g(-1) VS. The quality of fermentation residue was sufficient to serve as biofertilizer, with enriched amounts of potassium, sulfur and iron. We further demonstrated the upscaling feasibility of the process in a pilot-scale system where a CH4 recovery of 189 L kg(-1) VS was achieved and a biogas composition of 55% CH4 and 38% CO2 was recorded.","Barbot, YN; Thomsen, C; Thomsen, L; Benz, R",macroalgae; waste management; biogas; Laminaria japonica; industrial residuals; biomethane; flue gas condensate; maize co-digestion; thermo-acidic pretreatment,2015,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md13095947,Physical,thermal,,algae,laminaria,,,,,,,,,

Pilot study of thermal alkaline pretreatment of waste activated sludge: Seasonal effects on anaerobic digestion and impact on dewaterability and refractory COD,"Thermal alkaline pretreatment (TAP) of waste activate sludge (WAS) was carried out in pilot-scale over a year to investigate its seasonal effects on anaerobic digestion and its impact on dewaterability, sludge liquor quality and formation of soluble refractory COD (sCOD(ref)). Temperature of TAP was set at 65-70 degrees C and pH was increased by initial dosing of sodium hydroxide [NaOH] (50% w/w, 1-2.5 mL/L sludge) as alkali agent following 2-2.5 h reaction time. Pilot digesters were fed with primary sludge (PS) and hydrolyzed WAS (HWAS) and compared to a reference digester fed with PS and untreated WAS. Biogas yield increase due to TAP of WAS showed a sinusoidal trend throughout the year with maximum in summer (+42%), minimum in winter (+3%) and average of +20%, indicating a strong seasonal effect on TAP efficiency. Ammonium [NH4+ - N], orthophosphate [PO43--P] and sulphate [SO42-] in sludge liquor increased by 34.6%, 17.0% and 21.6% with TAP, respectively. Centrifugation tests showed no significant difference in dewaterability of both digestates with respect to total solids of sludge cake. Normalized capillary suction time of digestate increased due to TAP, indicating a lower capability for water release. Furthermore, detected sCOD(ref) after batch aerobic biodegradation tests showed an increase of 30.3% with TAP. Hence, implementation of TAP of WAS in full-scale will potentially lead to an increase of 0.8-1.1 mg/L of sCOD(ref) in effluent of six wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in Berlin. In conclusion, TAP of WAS leads to increase in biogas production with a slighter negative impact on effluent COD quality than high-temperature thermal hydrolysis. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

A cost analysis of this study reveals that MW + H2O2 + acid was the most economical method with a net profit of 59.90 a,not sign/t of sludge.","Eswari, P; Kavitha, S; Kaliappan, S; Yeom, IT; Banu, JR",Advanced oxidation processes; Biogas production; Combined pretreatment; Microwave; Anaerobic biodegradability; Sludge disintegration; Cost analysis,2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6543-2,Chemical,acidic,,activated sludge,dairy activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Biogas production by co-digestion of sodium hydroxide pretreated Napier grass and food waste for community sustainability,"Community agricultural waste-to-energy management, especially in developing countries, can respond to sustainable development goals by the United Nations. Co-digestion techniques for waste from phytomass in fields as Napier grass (NP) and debris from consumption in the community as food waste (FW) into biogas production by conventional anaerobic digestion technology contribute to sustainable energy communities. However, lignocellulose requires proper pretreatment of the material type. Therefore, low sodium hydroxide (NaOH) concentration for Napier grass pretreatment and varying the co-digestion ratio with food waste from the community under conventional batch conditions were optimized to be economically cost-effective with elementary technology. The results showed the highest methane yield at 0.285 m(3)/kg VSadded at the 4% concentration of sodium hydroxide pretreatment with significant content of FW added with biomass. The best conditions of co-substrates can increase methane yields by up to 3.54 times compared to a single substrate. The energy and cost estimation based on energy consumption and chemical input cost showed that co-digestion with NaOH pretreatment could achieve the net benefits by increasing the biogas production (242 US$/tonne TS). This study confirms the application of waste management in agricultural communities that can be used as fuel in households to increase biogas and economic value. The authors expect this work to be a successful case study for further results that lack government financial support and limitations of advanced technology for a sustainable community.","Pinpatthanapong, K; Boonnorat, J; Glanpracha, N; Rangseesuriyachai, T",Waste to energy; Napier grass; food waste; sodium hydroxide pretreatment; biogas production; co-digestion,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15567036.2022.2055232,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,lignocellulose,napier grass,grass,,,,,,,,
Enhancement of anaerobic digestion efficiency of wastewater sludge and olive waste: Synergistic effect of co-digestion and ultrasonic/microwave sludge pre-treatment,"This study investigates the effect of ultrasonic and microwave pre-treatment on biogas production from the anaerobic co-digestion of olive pomace and wastewater sludges. It was found that co-digestion of wastewater sludge with olive pomace yielded around 0.21 L CH4/g VSadded, whereas the maximum methane yields from the mono-digestion of olive pomace and un-pretreated wastewater sludges were 0.18 and 0.16 L CH4/g VSadded. In the same way, compared to mono-digestion of these substrates, co-digestion increased methane production by 17-31%. The microwave and ultrasonic pre-treatments applied to sludge samples prior to co-digestion process led to further increase in the methane production by 52% and 24%, respectively, compared to co-digestion with un-pretreated wastewater sludge. The highest biogas and methane yields were obtained from the co-digestion of 30 min microwave pre-treated wastewater sludges and olive pomace to be 0.46 L/g VSadded and 032 L CH4/g VSadded, respectively.

Effect of ozonation and ultrasonication pretreatment processes on co-digestion of tannery solid wastes,"Studies were carried out by the application of ozonation and ultrasonication as pretreatment processes on primary and secondary sludge generated during treatment of tannery wastewater to enhance the soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD).

"Potential of Lignin-Rich Grass, Pennisetum purpureum x Pennisetum typhoideum, as a Feedstock for Biogas Production","Effects of harvesting ages (45, 70, and 90 days), pretreatments (fresh and silage), and temperatures (35 degrees C and 55 degrees C) on biogas production fromP. purpureum x P. typhoideum(giant juncao grass, GJG) were investigated. The biochemical methane potential test was used to determine specific methane yields, and results were simulated using the modified Gompertz model. GJGs at younger harvesting ages gave higher specific methane yields, partly due to their lower lignin content. Ensiled GJGs tended to offer superior degradation performance to fresh grass under mesophilic conditions. However, under thermophilic conditions, similar specific methane yields were obtained, suggesting that effects of high temperature digestion prevailed over ensiling process advantages. Higher specific methane yields were attained under thermophilic conditions for GJGs having the same harvesting age and pretreatment. Owing to its high mass yield, the fresh 90-day GJG was recommended as the feedstock for biogas production under thermophilic conditions. Methane yield up to10,356 m3 CH4 ha-1 year-1was provided from this grass, which was 1.6-90.1 times higher than that estimated from other biomass types investigated.

Contribution of solid and liquid fractions of sewage sludge pretreated by high pressure homogenization to biogas production,"High pressure homogenization (HPH) pretreatment can effectively enhance anaerobic sludge digestion. In order to understand the corresponding mechanisms, different homogenization pressures were applied on sewage sludge, and solid and liquid fractions were separately digested to clarify contribution of solid and liquid fractions to biogas production. Results showed that the methane was mainly produced from solid fraction, and methane yield was increased with the increase of pretreatment pressure. The biogas and methane production from sludge (digested without solid-liquid separation) was 17% and 45% higher than the sum of that from solid and liquid fractions (digested separately) under a pressure of 40 MPa, respectively. This indicated that the sludge liquid fraction synergistically improved the biodegradation of sludge solids. The improvement of anaerobic digestion was attributed to organic release by sludge disintegration, sludge disruption and further increase of particle surface area. The methane production was linear with effectiveness of HPH pretreatment.","Nabi, M; Zhang, GM; Zhang, PY; Tao, X; Wang, SQ; Ye, JP; Zhang, Q; Zubair, M; Bao, S; Wu, Y",HPH pretreatment; Separation of sludge solid and liquid; Biogas production; Organic release; Sludge particle decrease,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.121378,Physical,pressure,high pressure homogenization,activated sludge,secondary sludge,,,,,,,,,
Thermophilic anaerobic co-digestion of oil palm empty fruit bunches with palm oil mill effluent for efficient biogas production,"The effect of pretreatment methods for improved biodegradability and biogas production of oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) and its co-digestion with palm oil mill effluent (POME) was investigated. The maximum methane potential of POME was 502 mL CH4/g VS-added corresponding to 33.2 m(3) CH4/ton POME and 98% biodegradability. Meanwhile, the maximum methane potential of EFB was 202 mL CH4/g VS-added corresponding to 79.1 m(3) CH4/ton EFB with 38% biodegradability.

Biological Pretreatment of Chicken Feather and Biogas Production from Total Broth,"Chicken feathers are available in large quantities around the world causing environmental challenges. The feathers are composed of keratin that is a recalcitrant protein and is hard to degrade. In this work, chicken feathers were aerobically pretreated for 2-8 days at total solid concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 % by Bacillus sp. C-4, a bacterium that produces both alpha- and beta-keratinases. Then, the liquid fraction (feather hydrolysate) as well as the total broth (liquid and solid fraction of pretreated feathers) was used as substrates for biogas production using anaerobic sludge or bacteria granules as inoculum. The biological pretreatment of feather waste was productive; about 75 % of feather was converted to soluble crude protein after 8 days of degradation at initial feather concentration of 5 %. Bacteria granules performed better during anaerobic digestion of untreated feathers, resulting in approximately two times more methane yield (i.e., 199 mlCH(4)/gVS compared to 105 mlCH(4)/gVS when sludge was used). Pretreatment improved methane yield by 292 and 105 % when sludge and granules were used on the hydrolysate. Bacteria granules worked effectively on the total broth, yielded 445 mlCH(4)/gVS methane, which is 124 % more than that obtained with the same type of inoculum from untreated feather.","Patinvoh, RJ; Feuk-Lagerstedt, E; Lundin, M; Horvath, IS; Taherzadeh, MJ",Chicken feather; Pretreatment; Bacillus substilis strain; Keratinase; Biogas production; Mesophilic; Hydrolysate; Total broth; Bacteria granules,2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-016-2175-8,Biological,bacterial,bacillus c-4,other,chicken feathers,,,,,,,,,
Opportunities and challenges: Experimental and kinetic analysis of anaerobic co-digestion of food waste and rendering industry streams for biogas production,"Large amounts of food waste and sewage sludge exert a hazardous environmental impact in several countries. Producing biogas and digestate from food and industrial waste is one of the solutions for waste management, stabilization of sludge, resource and energy recovery and reductions in the amount of waste. However, biogas production from such substrates has challenges in degradation efficiency, inhibitory effects and other challenges, and thus co-digestion and pretreatment techniques could be applied to enhance biogas production. The aim this study is to explore the effects of co-digestion of food waste, meat and bone meal and rendering wastewater sludge. First, thermal pretreatment was performed (35 degrees C, 5 days) by adding the rendering-industry streams food waste in the amounts of 0, 5, 10 and 15% on a total solid basis, and further anaerobic digestion (40.5 degrees C, 40 days) was then performed. Both experimental and kinetic analysis were conducted, and the major factors regarding opportunities and challenges in the two-stage process are discussed. Results have shown that both substrates from rendering industry decreased the biogas yield of food waste. When 5% of them was added to food waste, meat and bone meal decreased biogas production by 12%, and wastewater sludge decreased it by 23%. Both co-substrates, on the other side, increased the rate of reaction of food waste digestion when applying different common kinetic models.","Bedoic, R; Spehar, A; Puljko, J; Cucek, L; Cosic, B; Puksec, T; Duic, N",Food waste; Rendering industry streams; Thermal pretreatment; Anaerobic co-digestion; Biogas production; Experimental research; Kinetic analysis,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2020.109951,Physical,thermal,,codigestion,food waste+meat+bone+wastewaters sludge,,,,,,,,,
Mature landfill leachate utilization using a cost-effective hybrid method,"The main goal of this study was to investigate the co-digestion of sewage sludge and mature landfill leachate pretreated through hydrodynamic cavitation. The process efficiency was analyzed from the aspects of organics removal, biogas production, kinetics and digestate quality. Energy efficiency of the overall treatment was evaluated as well. A dose of hydrodynamically cavitated leachate of 5% v/v was used as a substrate for co-digestion with sewage sludge at a hydraulic retention time of 20 days. This improved the kinetics, biogas production and corresponding yields, as well as digestate quality. Fourier transform infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy analysis seemed to indicate that no new toxic compounds were formed with co-digestion. The investigated two-stage treatment is recommended as a safe and cost-effective method of utilizing mature leachate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of co-substrate and thermal pretreatment on anaerobic digestion performance,"The influence of anaerobic co-digestion of leachate and sludge with organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) under mesophilic condition in three batch digesters of 5L capacity has been studied. OFMSW was mixed with leachate and sludge at three different ratios. Experimental results illustrated that the digester with a ratio of 2000/2500 (leachate (mL) or sludge/OFMSW (mL)) had significantly higher performance. Furthermore, this study compared the performance of anaerobic digestion of different substrates with three different mixing ratios with and without thermal pretreatment at low temperature (65 degrees C) in terms of biogas production, chemical oxygen demand (COD) elimination as well as hydraulic retention time. In addition, to predict the biogas yield and evaluate the kinetic parameters, the modified Gompertz model was applied. Based on the results, the maximum biogas yield from adding different leachate and sludge ratios to OFMSW was recorded to be 0.45 and 0.38m(3)kg(-1) COD which was higher about 7% in comparison with co-digestion original OFMSW without thermal pretreatment. In addition, thermal pretreatment accelerated the hydrolysis step. Moreover, the total COD elimination was relatively stable in the range of 52-60% at all types of substrate mixtures. Also, the modified Gompertz model demonstrated a good fit to the experimental results.","Amiri, L; Abdoli, MA; Gitipour, S; Madadian, E",Organic fraction of municipal solid waste; leachate; sludge; anaerobic co-digestion; biogas; thermal pretreatment; kinetic study,2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2016.1260643,Physical,thermal,,ofmsw,municipal solid waste,,,,,,,,,
"Anaerobic digestion of cattle manure, corn silage and sugar beet pulp mixtures after thermal pretreatment and kinetic modeling study","In this study, biogas production was investigated from cattle manure (CM), corn silage (CS) and sugar beet pulp (SBP) mixtures under mesophilic conditions. In anaerobic digestion (AD), CM, CS and SBP were mixed in different ratios and the optimum mixture ratio was determined as 2:1:1, w/w/w respectively. In this mixture, biogas production was 180.5 mL/g TS. After the optimum mixing ratios of CM, CS and SBP were determined, thermal pretreatments were applied to this mixture ratio. Thermal pretreatments were performed at 100, 120, 150 and 180 degrees C with 10, 20, 30, 60 and 120 min for each temperature. Considering biogas production after thermal pretreatment, the best thermal pretreatment time was determined as 60 min for all pretreatment temperatures. The highest biogas yield was 362.1 mL/g TS in the reactor which is pretreated at 180 degrees C for 60 min. After thermal pretreatment at 180 degrees C for 60 min, the SCOD value in the reactor increased by 124.6% compared to the control.

An Economical Method for Simultaneously Improving Pretreatment and Anaerobic Fermentation Effects on Corn Straw Using Ultra-Low Concentration FeCl2,"Low pollution, slight corrosion, and low cost are the main challenges in the conversion of biomass to biogas. In this work, based on the whole process optimization of biomass conversion, an effective method using an ultra-low concentration of FeCl2 was proposed to simultaneously promote the biochemical reaction and improve the pretreatment effect. The concentration of FeCl2 in the pretreatment was determined according to the requirements of the minimum amount which led to the optimal performance of the anaerobic system and had economical importance. The effects of FeCl2 in the pretreatment and anaerobic fermentation were evaluated by comparing with that of distilled water in the production of hydrolysis products and organic acids. The optimal condition was obtained at 180 degrees C and 10 min with 1 x 10(-5) mol/L FeCl2 pretreatment. At that condition, hemicellulose achieved a high conversion of 97.6%, and the released xylose reached nearly 95%.

An Economical Method for Simultaneously Improving Pretreatment and Anaerobic Fermentation Effects on Corn Straw Using Ultra-Low Concentration FeCl2,"Low pollution, slight corrosion, and low cost are the main challenges in the conversion of biomass to biogas. In this work, based on the whole process optimization of biomass conversion, an effective method using an ultra-low concentration of FeCl2 was proposed to simultaneously promote the biochemical reaction and improve the pretreatment effect. The concentration of FeCl2 in the pretreatment was determined according to the requirements of the minimum amount which led to the optimal performance of the anaerobic system and had economical importance. The effects of FeCl2 in the pretreatment and anaerobic fermentation were evaluated by comparing with that of distilled water in the production of hydrolysis products and organic acids. The optimal condition was obtained at 180 degrees C and 10 min with 1 x 10(-5) mol/L FeCl2 pretreatment. At that condition, hemicellulose achieved a high conversion of 97.6%, and the released xylose reached nearly 95%. At least 77.5% of the organic matter in the solution can be utilized for subsequent fermentation. FeCl2 pretreatment also accelerated the anaerobic acidification fermentation process and promoted organic acid yields. The work provided a meaningful and economical choice for the conversion technology of biomass to biogas.","Qiao, YN; Lu, XB; Zhi, ZH; Zhang, ST",FeCl2; pretreatment; catalyst; ultra-low concentration; anaerobic fermentation; biogas; nutritional components; whole process optimization; corn straw,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en13071779,Physical,thermal,,lignocellulose,corn,straw,,,,,,,,
Efficiency of Two-Phase Anaerobic Fermentation and the Physicochemical Properties of the Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste Processed in a Vortex-Layer Apparatus,"Pretreatment of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) is a necessary step to accelerate the process of anaerobic digestion in order to avoid rapid acidification and inhibition of methanogenesis. This work shows for the first time the effect of pretreatment in a vortex-layer apparatus (VLA) on the physicochemical properties and characteristics of the anaerobic thermophilic, two-phase fermentation of OFMSW. Pretreatment in a VLA led to a decrease in the amount of fat, an increase in pH, a slight increase in the amount of protein in dry matter, and a change in the density and dry matter content. OFMSW processing in a VLA for 2 min increased the specific yield of biogas and methane by 11.6 and 15.8%, respectively.","Mikheeva, ER; Katraeva, IV; Vorozhtsov, DL; Litti, YV; Nozhevnikova, AN",organic fraction of municipal solid waste; vortex-layer apparatus; pretreatment; biogas; thermophilic process; two-phase anaerobic fermentation,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0003683820060113,Physical,mechanical desintegration,vortex-layer apparatus,ofmsw,model substrate,,,,,,,,,
Co-digestion of organic solid waste and sludge from sewage treatment,"Solid organic wastes were codigested together with sludge of a sewage treatment plant (STP). In the practical part of the study, a plant to pretreat the organic solid wastes provided by local super markets was constructed at the STP of Frutigen, Switzerland. Up to more than 1 cubic metre of wastes was added to the fermenter of the STP every day. Data collected during 14 months of practical works, showed that for raw fruit and vegetable wastes a two step pretreatment is necessary: First the wastes were chopped and afterwards reduced to a size of 1-2 millimetres, in order to get a homogeneous suspension together with the primary sludge. The vegetable wastes showed excellent digestibility: They seemed to accelerate the digestion process as well as to increase the degree of the anaerobic degradation of the sludge. The energy demand for both, pretreatment and digestion, was 85 kWh/ton of fresh wastes. 20% of the energy was used for the hygienization, a step which does not seem to be necessary for this kind of waste in most of the cases, however. After using the gas for energy conversion, a net yield of 65 kWh/ton of electricity and 166 kWh/ton of heat was measured. Treating cooked kitchen wastes, the net energy production will be higher, because in this case a one step pretreatment will be sufficient. The pretreatment and treatment costs for codigestion on STP's were calculated to be in the range of 55 US$/ton treating half a ton per day and 39 US$/ton treating one ton, respectively. A theoretical feasibility study showed that in Switzerland there is a short term potential on STP's for the codigestion of about 120,000 tons of biogenic wastes per year without big investments. Economic studies about codigestion on agricultural biogas plants showed that the codigestion is a must at the current energy prices, which are far too low for agricultural AD without an additional income by treating solid wastes for third parties.","Edelmann, W; Engeli, H; Gradenecker, M",codigestion; organic solid waste; sewage treatment plant; agricultural; biogas production; economy; pretreatment; energy balance; hygiene; weed survival; sewage sludge,2000,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2000.0074,Physical,mechanical desintegration,chopping,food waste,food waste,,,,,,,,,
Efficient anaerobic digestion of a mild wet air pretreated molasses ethanol distillery stillage: A comparative approach,"The effect of a mild, wet air pretreatment and the subsequent anaerobic digestion (AD) was examined on the recovery of a complex and toxic molasses ethanol distillery stillage. The biogas yield and organics removal due to pretreatment were compared with the raw stillage AD. The application of a scoria support in this industrial residue AD process stability was also assessed. Consequently, a statistically significant cumulative specific methane recovery difference (p-value = 0.000) with an almost complete biological oxygen demand (BOD) removal and a significant chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction, which were 100% and 92% respectively were achieved. Additionally, the biogas recovery rate was hastened due to pretreatment. The application of scoria, whose property has been instrumentally inspected, has helped stabilize the pH in the AD systems. In a comparative approach, this study suggests the energy benefit and an ecofriendly discharge of stillage by the ethanol industry towards sustainability.","Gebreeyessus, GD; Sreekrishnan, TR; Mekonnen, A; Chebude, Y; Alemayehu, E",Chemical engineering; Bioengineering; Environmental science; Environmental engineering; Environmental hazard; Environmental health; Environmental management; Environmental pollution; Environmental risk assessment; Environmental toxicology; Biogas; Chemical oxygen demand; Scoria; Stillage; Wet air pretreatment,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05539,Chemical,oxidizer,wet oxidation,food industry organic waste,ethanol distillery stillage molasse,,,,,,,,,
Renewable energy: evaluation of low energy demand pre-treatments to optimise methane production from microalgae,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) of microalgae is a sustainable process to produce methane-rich biogas for bioenergy production. However, the rigid cell walls of microalgae protect them against the attack from hydrolytic bacteria, and consequently prevent efficient biodegradability and lower methane production. In this study, the effects of low energy demand enzymatic and low-temperature thermo-alkaline pre-treatments on microalgae AD were investigated in batch biochemical methane potential tests. The results found that methane yields were significantly enhanced by both pre-treatments. Microalgae Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris) after enzymatic pre-treatment enhanced methane yields the most, by 22-162%, whilst C. vulgaris pre-treated by thermo-alkaline pre-treatment improved methane yields by 4-26%. In enzymatic pre-treatment, C. vulgaris pre-treated with mixed enzymes showed higher methane yields compared to single enzymes. In low-temperature thermo-alkaline pre-treatment, the level of enhancement in methane yields depended on the alkaline dosage and pre-treatment temperature, but the high alkaline dosages were associated with limitations such as a prolonged lag phase in the digestion process. From an energy viewpoint, both pre-treatments showed positive energy balances for the majority of experimental conditions, and therefore both pre-treatments are considered to be energetically efficient methods to pre-treat microalgae for methane production via AD.","Zhang, YHZ; Caldwell, GS; Sallis, PJ",heat treatment; bioenergy conversion; biotechnology; biodegradable materials; renewable materials; microorganisms; biofuel; enzymes; higher methane yields; renewable energy evaluation; methane-rich biogas; bioenergy production; lower methane production; low energy demand enzymatic; microalgae AD; batch biochemical methane potential tests; pretreatment temperature; enzymatic pretreatment enhanced methane yields; low-temperature thermo-alkaline pretreatments; low energy demand pretreatments; thermo-alkaline pretreatment improved methane yields,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-rpg.2018.6080,Biological,enzyme,,micro-algae,chlorella,,,,,,,,,

Mild hydrogen peroxide interceded bacterial disintegration of waste activated sludge for efficient biomethane production,"Regardless of the issue of sludge management all over the world, the role of phase separated pretreatment prior to anaerobic digestion are more promising in terms of energy efficient biomethane production. However, the effect of phase separated pretreatment (dissociation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) followed by biological pretreatment in a two-step process) must be sensibly evaluated from various perceptions to consolidate its effectiveness in sludge management and bioenergy recovery. In this study, mild hydrogen peroxide induced bacterial pretreatment (H2O2-BP) was employed as phase separated pretreatment to investigate the effectiveness of EPS dissociation prior to biological pretreatment on sludge solubilization and biomethanation. The novelty of this study is the application of mild dosage of hydrogen peroxide at sludge pH for the removal of EPS layer with lesser formation of recalcitrant substances which thereby enhances the disintegration by enzyme secreting bacterial and methane generation.

Calcium peroxide pre-treatment improved the anaerobic digestion of primary sludge and its co-digestion with waste activated sludge,"Primary sludge (PS) and Waste activated sludge (WAS) as two main sludge streams in wastewater treatment plants are commonly anaerobically co-digested, which though may be differently affected by pretreatment. Previous work has found that calcium peroxide (CaO2) pretreatment effectively enhanced anaerobic digestion of WAS. However, the feasibilities of this strategy on PS anaerobic digestion and co-digestion of WAS and PS are still unclear. Herein, this work provided new insights into these systems. Biomethane potential test demonstrated that CaO2 pretreatment at 0.02-0.26 g/g-volatile suspended solids (VSS) promoted anaerobic digestion of PS. Then the feasibility of CaO2 pretreatment for improving anaerobic co-digestion of PS and WAS mixture was confirmed, with the highest improvement in methane production, VSS destruction and sludge reduction being approximately 37.4%, 38.9% and 19.9%, achieved at 0.14 g/g-VSS of CaO2. Process modelling analysis revealed that CaO2 pretreatment increased both degradable faction and actually degraded fraction in sludge mixture. The changes of sludge characteristics via pretreatment and key enzyme activity in sludge anaerobic co-digestion system demonstrated that increased CaO2 concentration resulted in increased soluble organics release from sludge mixture in the pretreatment stage and inhibited activity of coenzyme F420 responsible for methanogenesis. Further mechanism investigation disclosed that OH-, center dot O-2(-) and center dot OH were main contribution factors, and the order of their contributions were OH- > center dot O-2(-) > center dot OH. This work laid the theoretical foundation and provided guidance for the practical application of CaO2 pre-treatment technology.","Wei, W; Shi, XD; Wu, L; Liu, XQ; Ni, BJ",Pretreatment technology; Biomethane potential test; Sludge reduction; Kinetics; Mechanism,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154404,Chemical,oxidizer,peroxide cao2,activated sludge,mixed sludge,,,,,,,,,
Biomethane production kinetics of rumen pretreated lignocellulosic wastes,"Bioenergy production from lignocellulosic biomass is challenging due to its complex structure. Therefore, a pretreatment is required before methane production. Studies investigating the pretreatment of lignocellulosic waste using rumen fluid are limited and focused only on a certain waste. In this study, pretreatment by rumen microorganisms was applied for different types of lignocellulosic wastes: wheat straw, cotton stalk, reeds and sunflower stalk. The reactors containing 1 g waste were pretreated for 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20 days to investigate optimum pretreatment time for methane production. After the pretreatment stages and gas measurements, reactors were separated into two phases as solid phase and liquid phase. The reactors were installed for the anaerobic digestion; gas measurements were made cumulatively. Modified Gompertz equation was used to estimate potential biogas production. The maximum biogas productions were obtained in 2 days pretreatment of wheat straw, reeds and sunflower stalk with 1.2 to 1.4-fold increase compared to non-pretreated wastes.

Enhanced digestibility and fermentability of sugarcane bagasse in biofuel production by surfactant-assisted dilute acid pretreatment,"In this study, various combined pretreatment strategies using liquid hot water (LHW), 60 % ethanol, 1% H2SO4 and 0.5 % NaOH together with different surfactants (PEG 6000, Triton X-100 and Tween 80) were evaluated to improve glucose production from sugarcane bagasse (SCB) during enzymatic hydrolysis. After pretreatment with PEG 6000-assisted 1% H2SO4, the highest glucose yield of 75.04 % was achieved. Pretreatments of SCB with various combinations of H2SO4 (1-3%, w/v) and PEG 6000 (0-1.5 %, w/v) were further investigated for enhancing enzymatic hydrolysis and ethanol production. When 1.5 % PEG 6000 was introduced during pretreatment with 2 % H2SO4, the highest glucose yield of 86.14 % and ethanol concentration of 20.17 g/L were liberated, which were much higher than those obtained from pretreatment with 2% H2SO4 alone. This increased digestibility and fermentability can be attributed to decreases in crystalline sizes and PEG 6000 adherence to SCB surfaces, which was confirmed by cellulase adsorption isotherms, FT-IR, XRD, and SEM analysis. In addition, prehydrolysate and the stillage remaining after ethanol production were sequentially digested to seek potential biomethane production and resulted in final methane yields of 264.05 mL and 387.77 mL per g of volatile solids, respectively.

Higher energy conversion ef fi ciency in anaerobic degradation of bioplastic by response surface methodology,"Anaerobic degradation of bioplastics is a controversial challenge. Size reduction is a must for degradation while it requires a significant amount of energy, which lowers the overall energy efficiency of the system. On the other hand, inoculum to substrate ratio has interaction effects in the process. The present work aimed to optimize these two parameters for the improvement of energy efficiency through response surface methodology. The central composite design procedure was implied. The levels of the experimental variables were 0.72, 4.3, 7.87 mm for particle size and 2, 3, and 4 for inoculum to substrate ratio. The input variable effects on biomethane yield were estimated, discussed, and then also optimized using the genetic algorithm. Moreover, energy balance analysis was done for the samples. The highest biomethane yield was found at the particle size of 4.3 mm and inoculum to substrate ratio of 4, which corresponds to 23% energy efficiency. Despite the high energy consumption for size reduction to less than 1 mm, more biomethane yield was not observed. Inoculum to substrate ratio showed more effect on biomethane yield than particle size. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The energy potential of cotton straw in case of an evaluation of these biomass residues was also determined using fuel cell technology. Acid pretreatment provided the highest yield in biogas formation as well as sugar extraction from the raw sample. The highest biohydrogen and biomethane production were obtained as 33 mL H-2/g VS and 83 mL CH4/g VS, respectively.

Surfactant assisted microwave disintegration of green marine macroalgae for enhanced anaerobic biodegradability and biomethane recovery,"In this research work, an effort was done to improve the liquefaction potential of green marine macroalgae (GMM) through surfactant induced microwave pretreatment (SMP) in an energy efficient aspect.

Available methane from anthracite by combining coal seam microflora andH(2)O(2)pretreatment,"The conversion of coal to methane by anaerobic microorganisms is an efficient, clean, and green way to utilize coal. However, methane production is relatively low due to the low bioavailability of coal. H(2)O(2)has been demonstrated to increase methane production by transferring coal to liquid organics. Little is known about the bioavailability of residual coal after H(2)O(2)pretreatment. Here, H(2)O(2)was employed to pretreat anthracite, and the potential of residual coal to produce methane was analyzed. The optimum conditions for pretreatment were 30% H(2)O(2)for 12 hours when the methane production reached 254.97 mu mol/g coal, increased by 24.98% compared with that in unpretreated coal. The results of FTIR showed that the substitutions of aromatics, alkanes rings, aliphatics, and even C=C structure in coal were depolymerized and oxygen-containing functional groups were generated after pretreatment with H2O2. The oxygen-containing functional groups were further degraded by anaerobic microflora. The XRD results showed that the crystal structure of coal decreased after pretreatment with H(2)O(2)following 27 days of cultivation. These results suggested that H(2)O(2)pretreatment mainly altered coal by increasing the oxygen-containing functional groups and decreasing the crystal structure of coal to facilitate coal biodegradation and enhance biomethane production. The effect of H(2)O(2)on the production of biomethane was not only to produce easily degradable organics, but also to change the coal structure and promote the degradation of residual coal. Therefore, the enhancement of biomethane production by H(2)O(2)pretreatment on surface bioconversion and underground coalbed methane mining should take the increase methane yield from residual coal into account.","Guo, HG; Han, Q; Zhang, JL; Liang, WG; Huang, ZX; Urynowicz, M; Ali, MI",biomethane; anthracite; H(2)O(2)pretreatment; FTIR; XRD,2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/er.5890,Chemical,oxidizer,peroxide h2o2,other,coal,,,,,,,,,
TiO2 - chitosan thin film induced solar photocatalytic deflocculation of sludge for profitable bacterial pretreatment and biofuel production,The proposed research intended to acquire the perception of proficient biomethane generation enhanced by TiO2 embedded chitosan thin film (TCTF) mediated enzyme secreting bacterial pretreatment of sludge. Impregnates 0.05 g/g SS TiO2 dosage on chitosan solid matrix effectively disperse sludge flocs and induces deflocculation of 99.35%. This TCTF enhances the enzyme secreting bacterial disintegration by increasing the hydrolytic activity. A higher solubilisation of 16% achieved in TCTF mediated bacterial disintegration while related to enzyme secreting bacterial disintegration alone. The high specific growth rate of 0.2 h(-1) for enzyme secreting bacterial growth rate is attained at 42 h. Deflocculation and enzyme secreting bacterial pretreatment has a major impact on methane potential assay. The sludge sample TCTF mediated bacterial disintegration yields 140.40 mL/g COD higher methane than the other samples.

Improving biohydrogen and biomethane co-production via two-stage dark fermentation and anaerobic digestion of the pretreated seaweed Laminaria digitata,"The marine macro-alga Laminaria digitata is an abundant brown seaweed, which may be used as a feedstock for gaseous biofuel production via sequential dark fermentation and anaerobic digestion. Various methods, including hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP), hydrothermal dilute acid pretreatment (HTDAP), enzymolysis, and combinations thereof, were employed to depolymerize L. digitata and assess the effects on biohydrogen and biomethane yields. Scanning electron microscopic images revealed that the intact and smooth structure of the seaweed was severely damaged; some micro-pores and debris were generated after HTP (140 degrees C for 20 min), whilst the undegraded components remained as filamentous structures. The complex carbohydrate polymers in L. digitata constrained the catalytic effects of glucoamylase, leading to limited increase in the yield of carbohydrate monomers. With the aid of H2SO4 (1 v/v%) in HTP, depolymerization of biomass and its further conversion to carbohydrate monomers were significantly improved. The yield of total carbohydrate monomers after HTDAP (0.564 g/gVS) was 3.5-fold that in raw biomass; this led to an increase of 60.8% in biohydrogen yield (57.4 mL/gVS) in the first-stage dark fermentation. However, the generation of byproducts such as hydroxymethylfurfural under such harsh conditions impaired the second-stage anaerobic digestion of hydrogenogenic effluent, resulting in a 25.9% decrease in biomethane yield. HTP was considered the optimum pretreatment improving energy conversion efficiency from seaweed to gaseous biofuels by 26.7% as compared to that of the unpretreated L. digitata.

Scanning electron microscopic images revealed that the intact and smooth structure of the seaweed was severely damaged; some micro-pores and debris were generated after HTP (140 degrees C for 20 min), whilst the undegraded components remained as filamentous structures. The complex carbohydrate polymers in L. digitata constrained the catalytic effects of glucoamylase, leading to limited increase in the yield of carbohydrate monomers. With the aid of H2SO4 (1 v/v%) in HTP, depolymerization of biomass and its further conversion to carbohydrate monomers were significantly improved. The yield of total carbohydrate monomers after HTDAP (0.564 g/gVS) was 3.5-fold that in raw biomass; this led to an increase of 60.8% in biohydrogen yield (57.4 mL/gVS) in the first-stage dark fermentation. However, the generation of byproducts such as hydroxymethylfurfural under such harsh conditions impaired the second-stage anaerobic digestion of hydrogenogenic effluent, resulting in a 25.9% decrease in biomethane yield. HTP was considered the optimum pretreatment improving energy conversion efficiency from seaweed to gaseous biofuels by 26.7% as compared to that of the unpretreated L. digitata.

"Enhanced anaerobic co-digestion of fat, oil, and grease by calcium addition: Boost of biomethane production and microbial community shift","This work focused on the application of calcium (0.1-1% w/v) to overcome the inhibition caused by the high loadings (2% v/v) of fat, oil, and grease (FOG) in the context of biomethane production, organic removal, and microbial community shift. Addition of 0.5% calcium showed maximum biomethane production (6-fold increase); biomethane production decreased following the addition of calcium (> 0.5%). The highest organic removal rates were 83 and 89% upon the addition of 0.3 and 0.5% calcium, respectively. Addition of calcium facilitated the growth of bacteria of phylum Firmicutes from the Clostridium, Syntrophomonas, and Sedimentibacter genera. The population of members from the genus Methanosaeta increased after the addition of 0.5% calcium, which is one of the factors responsible for high biomethane production. This study demonstrated that addition of calcium is an attractive strategy to avoid the inhibition of the growth of anaerobic microflora due to the presence of high FOG concentrations.","Salama, E; Jeon, BH; Kurade, MB; Patil, SM; Usman, M; Li, XK; Lim, H","Fat, oil, and grease; Anaerobic co-digestion; Microbial community; Calcium pretreatment; Biomethane",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.122353,Process improvement,nutrient,calcium,other,lipids,,,,,,,,,
Anaerobic bioprocessing of wastewater-derived duckweed: Maximizing product yields in a biorefinery value cascade,"This study integrated the sugar and carboxylate platforms to enhance duckweed processing in biorefineries. Two or three bioprocesses (ethanol fermentation, acidogenic digestion, and methanogenic digestion) were sequentially integrated to maximize the carbon-to-carbon conversion of wastewater-derived duckweed into bioproducts, through a series of laboratory-scale experiments. Reactors were fed either raw (dried), liquid-hot-waterpretreated, or enzymatically-saccharified duckweed. Subsequently, the target bioproduct was separated from the reactor liquor and the residues further processed. The total bioproduct carbon yield of 0.69 +/- 0.07 g per gram of duckweed-C was obtained by sequential acidogenic and methanogenic digestion. Three sequential bioprocesses revealed nearly as high yields (0.66 +/- 0.08 g of bioproduct-C per duckweed-C), but caused more gaseous carbon (dioxide) loss. For this three-stage value cascade, yields of each process in conventional units were: 0.186 +/- 0.001 g ethanol/g duckweed; 611 +/- 64 mg volatile fatty acids as acetic acid/g VS; and 434 +/- 0.2 ml methane/g VS.","Calicioglu, O; Richard, TL; Brennan, RA",Biorefinery; Bioethanol; Lemna obscura; Volatile fatty acids; Biomethane; Carboxylate platform; Liquid hot water pretreatment,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.121716,Physical,thermal,liquid hot water,lignocellulose,duckweed,plant,,,,,,,,

Improving gaseous biofuel production from seaweed Saccharina latissima: The effect of hydrothermal pretreatment on energy efficiency,"Marine macroalgae (seaweed) is a promising feedstock for producing biohydrogen and biomethane via dark fermentation and anaerobic digestion, respectively. However, one of the limiting steps in the biological process is the conversion of polymeric carbohydrates into monomeric sugars. Here hydrothermal pretreatments were assessed for hydrolysis and subsequent production of biohydrogen and biomethane from the brown seaweed Saccharina latissima. The solubilization of S. latissima improved with increasing temperatures from 100 to 180 degrees C, resulting in a maximum yield of 0.70 g soluble chemical oxygen demand/gram volatile solid (sCOD/g VS); equivalent to an increase of 207.5% compared with untreated seaweed. However, the yield of the derived monomeric sugar mannitol peaked at 140 degrees C and decreased with increasing temperatures, likely due to production of fermentative inhibitors. Microstructural characterization revealed that the algal structure was significantly damaged, and the major chemical groups of carbohydrates and proteins were weakened after pretreatment. Regardless of hydrothermal temperatures, biohydrogen yield only slightly increased in dark fermentation, while biomethane yield significantly increased from 281.4 (untreated S. latissima) to 345.1 mL/g VS (treated at 140 degrees C), leading to the sCOD removal efficiency of 86.1%. The maximum energy conversion efficiency of 72.8% was achieved after two-stage biohydrogen and biomethane co-production. In comparison, considering the energy input for pretreatment/fermentation/digestion, the highest process energy efficiency dropped to 37.8%. Further calculations suggest that a significant improvement of efficiency up to 56.9% can be achieved if the heat from pretreatment can be recovered.","Lin, RC; Deng, C; Ding, LK; Bose, A; Murphy, JD",Macroalgae; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Energy efficiency; Biohydrogen; Biomethane,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.06.044,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,algae,Saccharina,,,,31.5,2.2,14.3,,,
A novel strategy for efficient anaerobic co-digestion based on the pretreatment of corn stover with fresh vinegar residue,"A novel method was advanced for efficient anaerobic co-digestion by using fresh vinegar residue (FVR) as acidifier for pretreating corn stover (CS). FVR acted as one substrate as well as an acidifier by the acids contained in FVR. It was found that the organic acids in FVR could efficiently enhance the hydrolysis of lignocellulose in CS. The biomethane production from co-digestion of FVR and CS pretreated reached 140.48 L/kg VS, which was 35.7% higher than that of unpretreated mixture substrates. The highest biomethane production was obtained when pretreatment was conducted at 150 degrees C. The increase of biomethane production was contributed to the improved hydrolysis of CS due to the acidic pretreatment. Pretreatment and co-digestion could improve the asynchronism and generate synergistic effect. The study provides one novel method for efficient biomethane conversion from FVR and CS.","Wen, HL; Wachemo, AC; Zhang, L; Zuo, XY; Yuan, HR; Li, XJ",Vinegar residue; Corn stover; Pretreatment; Biomethane production; Asynchronism; Synergistic effect,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.121412,Chemical,acidic,fresh vinegar residue,lignocellulose,corn,stover,95,91.2,44,0.7,64,40,31.5,4.4
Comparison of microwave thermohydrolysis and liquid hot water pretreatment of energy crop Sida hermaphrodita for enhanced methane production,"The study was aimed to compare the methane potential from the silage of Sida hermaphrodita mixed with cattle manure pretreated by microwave (MW) thermohydrolysis with liquid hot water (LHW) pretreatment. It was illustrated that both pretreatment methods significantly improved degradation of the lignocellulosic structure and improved the methane production. The maximum methane production of MW pretreated biomass was 590 NL/kg VS at 150 degrees C and 15 min with an improvement of 39.1% to an untreated sample. In turn, LHW treatment provided the maximum methane production of 575 NL/kg VS with the same pretreatment conditions. The net energy output significantly higher than calculated for the control sample was achieved only for MW pretreatment at 150 degrees C and 15-30 min. In other variants, pretreatment step needed higher energy input than the net energy gain from methane production.","Zielinski, M; Kisielewska, M; Dudek, M; Rusanowska, P; Nowicka, A; Krzemieniewski, M; Kazimierowicz, J; Debowski, M",Energy crop; Virginia mallow; Lignocellulosic biomass; Liquid hot water pretreatment; Microwave radiation; Biomethane,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2019.105324,Physical,thermal,"microwave,liquid hot water",lignocellulose,sida hermaphrodita,plant,,,,,,,,
"Synergistic effect of combined pretreatment in solubilizing fruits and vegetable residue for biogas production: Hydrolysis, energy assessment","The present study focusses on liquefying potential of fruits and vegetable residue through Dimethyl sulphoxide (DSMO) combined ultrasonic pretreatment (DCUP).

At optimised condition (ultrasonic power 90 W; solid concentration 30 g/L and surfactant dosage 0.008 g/g SS), greater percentage of SOR rate of 22% was achieved in DCUP than ultrasonic pretreatment (UP) (17%) with specific energy consumption of 5400 kJ/kg TS. Biofermentation assay in terms of volatile fatty acids (VFA) indicates higher VFA production in DCUP (1800 mg/L) than UP (1200 mg/L).

Enhancing biomethane potential of pulp and paper sludge through disperser mediated polyhydroxyalkanoates,"In the present study, the extraction of polyester like polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) from enzymes extracted sludge was investigated by varying extraction time and chloroform - sodium hypochlorite dosage. Maximum of 874 mg/g of PHAs was achieved at an optimum extraction time of 120 min and chloroform - sodium hypochlorite dosage of 30% v/v. The characteristics of derived PHAs were examined using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy. Then, the effect of derived PHAs dosage on biomethane production from pulp and paper mill secondary clarifier (PPSC) sludge was studied. Higher amount of biomethane production was observed to be 174 L/(kg VS) at 35 mg of PHAs dosage when compared to other dosage. To further enhance biomethane production, disperser pretreatment method was carried out by optimization of specific energy. At optimum specific energy of 8547 kJ/kg TS, the maximum solubilization rate and suspended solids (SS) reduction were found respectively to be 19% and 15.8%. Then, biomethane assay was conducted on disperser pretreated sludge, disperser pretreated sludge with optimized PHAs dosage (35 mg) and control sludge. Among these, disperser mediated PHAs method exhibited maximal biomethane production and was observed to be 267 L/(kg VS).

Hydrothermal processing as pretreatment for efficient production of ethanol and biogas from municipal solid waste,"Organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) is dominated by carbohydrates, including starch-based and lignocellulosic materials. The OFMSW was hydrothermally pretreated at 100-160 degrees C for 0-60 min, and then assessed for enzymatic ethanol production, followed by biogas production from the stillage. The highest glucose yield of 520 g/Kg of dry OFMSW, corresponding to 131% increase compared to that of the untreated OFMSW, was obtained after the pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. Through ethanolic fermentation by an inhibitory tolerant fungus, Mucor indicus, 191.10 g ethanol/Kg of dry OFMSW was obtained, which was a 140.9% improvement in the ethanol yield compared to that from the untreated one. Methane production from the stillage (waste residues) resulted in 156 L/Kg OFMSW. In other words, a total of 10,774 KJ energy/Kg of dry OFMSW was generated at the best conditions.","Mahmoodi, P; Karimi, K; Taherzadeh, MJ",Hydrothermal pretreatment; Municipal solid waste; Biomethane; Ethanol; Enzymatic hydrolysis,2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.03.115,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,ofmsw,municipal solid waste,,,,,,,,,

Baltic Sea seaweed biomass pretreatment: effect of combined CO2 and thermal treatment on biomethane potential,"The aim of this research is oriented towards the evaluation of the improvements of a combined CO2 and thermal pre-treatment on the biochemical methane potential (BMP) of Baltic Sea seaweed biomass. Four locally available algae of the Baltic Sea were tested. The values of BMP for untreated biomass were assessed with the following outputs: Fucus vesiculosus 97.9 mL CH4/gVS, Furcellaria lumbricalis 173.5 mL CH4/gVS, Cladophora sp. 377.1 mL CH4/gVS, and 364.8 mL CH4/gVS for Ulva intestinalis. The effects of the following selected thermal pre-treatments were investigated: boiling, microwaving and autoclaving, combined with the effects of an initial CO2 pre-treatment. The results show that biomass pre-treatment with CO2 at atmospheric pressure increased BMP by 1-13 %. The best results were obtained by combining CO2 treatment with subsequent autoclaving with an increase of the BMP for F. vesiculosus of 132.5 % (i.e. 227.6 mL CH4/gVS) and for F. lumbricalis of 116.4 % (i.e. 375.5 mL CH4/gVS). An increase of the BMP around 12-14 % was also observed for other two algae species that already had a high biomethane potential also in untreated conditions. Results show that algae biomass pre-treatment with CO2 at atmospheric pressure (low pressure, in respect to conventional 30-100 bar methods) combined with autoclaving could be effective method for BMP improvement.

Anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic biomasses pretreated with Ceriporiopsis subvermispora,"Fungal pretreatment by Ceriporiopsis subvermispora of two forest residues (hazel and acacia branches) and two agricultural lignocellulosic residues (barley straw and sugarcane bagasse) were studied as a pretreatment to improve their subsequent anaerobic digestion for methane production. Biomass samples were grinded to 2 ranges of particle sizes (<4 or 1 mm), autoclaved, inoculated with two strains of C. subvermispora (ATCC 90467 and ATCC 96608) and incubated at 28(circle)C for 28 days. The effects of fungal pretreatment were assessed by analyzing the samples before and after incubations for dry solids mass, biochemical composition, bio-methane production (BMP) and availability of cellulose to hydrolysis. The production of ligninolytic enzymes MnP and/or laccase was observed with both strains during incubation on most of the samples tested. It almost doubled the hazel branches BMP per unit mass of dry solids but did not improve however the BMP of the agricultural residues and acacia branches. These observations were explained by the fact that although both strains were able to degrade 20-25% of lignin in <1 mm and <4 mm hazel branches samples, none of them was successful however to significantly degrade lignin in the other samples, except for sugarcane bagasse.

"Biomethane Recovery from Fresh and Dry Water Hyacinth Anaerobic Co-Digestion with Pig Dung, Elephant Dung and Bat Dung with Different Alkali Pretreatments","Biomethane was produced from water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms), an aquatic weed plant, comprising of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin by using two steps of methods. The first was that fresh and dry water hyacinth in the length of 1 cm, were pretreated with 2 different alkali solutions; 2%(w/v) of NaOH and 10% (w/v) of Lime. The optimum condition was selected from 100, 120 and 140 degrees C for 4 hr at ratio of 1g (plant) per 15 ml of treatment solution. The yields of sugar from NaOH pretreatments were higher than lime conditions. The highest of sugar yield at 60 g (sugar) /g (substrate) was observed from 140 degrees C by using dry water hyacinth, whereas fresh hyacinth had yield at 36.7 g (sugar) /g (substrate). The second method was 12 sets of anaerobic co-digestions with 3 types of dung; pig dung, elephant dung and bat dung, and 2 types plants; fresh and dry hyacinth that pretreated by sodium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide. The mixtures of sugar solution and treated plant solid from both hyacinths were used as substrates by using 200 ml of waste water from sweet corn industrial as starter. The co-digestions were achieved at 1:1 ratio of dung and mixture solutions and at 37+/-2 degrees C under anaerobic condition for 45 days. The COD removal in rang of 51-69% were absorbed from all 12 conditions. The digestions from all lime treated plants showed higher methane concentration than NaOH treated plants. The lime treated fresh hyacinth had highest values of biochemical methane potential (BMP) and methane concentration were at 59.3% and 63.65 vol.%, respectively. They were equivalent to heating value at 12.58 MJ/m(3). The second was lime treated dry hyacinth that showed 32.4% BMP and 43.15 vol.% of methane, respectively. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The optimum condition was selected from 100, 120 and 140 degrees C for 4 hr at ratio of 1g (plant) per 15 ml of treatment solution. The yields of sugar from NaOH pretreatments were higher than lime conditions. The highest of sugar yield at 60 g (sugar) /g (substrate) was observed from 140 degrees C by using dry water hyacinth, whereas fresh hyacinth had yield at 36.7 g (sugar) /g (substrate). The second method was 12 sets of anaerobic co-digestions with 3 types of dung; pig dung, elephant dung and bat dung, and 2 types plants; fresh and dry hyacinth that pretreated by sodium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide. The mixtures of sugar solution and treated plant solid from both hyacinths were used as substrates by using 200 ml of waste water from sweet corn industrial as starter. The co-digestions were achieved at 1:1 ratio of dung and mixture solutions and at 37+/-2 degrees C under anaerobic condition for 45 days. The COD removal in rang of 51-69% were absorbed from all 12 conditions. The digestions from all lime treated plants showed higher methane concentration than NaOH treated plants. The lime treated fresh hyacinth had highest values of biochemical methane potential (BMP) and methane concentration were at 59.3% and 63.65 vol.%, respectively. They were equivalent to heating value at 12.58 MJ/m(3). The second was lime treated dry hyacinth that showed 32.4% BMP and 43.15 vol.% of methane, respectively. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Biologically pretreated sugarcane top as a potential raw material for the enhancement of gaseous energy recovery by two stage biohythane process,"The aim of the present study was to develop a suitable pretreatment method to enhance the microbial degradation of lignocellulosic biomass and to maximize the overall energy recovery by using biohythane process. An efficient and eco-friendly biological pretreatment was used. Maximum lignin removal using biological pretreatment of sugarcane top was 60.4% w/w after 21 d incubation at 28 degrees C in static condition. Confocal microscopy observation and FTIR analysis confirmed the removal of lignin from sugarcane top. The maximum hydrogen production rate (R-m), hydrogen production potential (P) and lag time (lambda) using pretreated sugarcane top were 16.76 mL/g-VS/h, 87.40 mL/g-VS and 3.38 h respectively. The maximum methane production potential using spent medium of dark fermentation was 180.86 mL/g-VS with the lag time of 2.9 d. The overall gaseous energy recovery was 37.7% which is 54% higher than that of the untreated one. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A biorefinery concept using the green macroalgae Chaetomorpha linum for the coproduction of bioethanol and biogas,"An innovative integrated biorefinery approach using the green macroalgae Chaetomorpha linum was investigated in the present study for the co-production of bioethanol and biogas. Among three pretreatments of C. linum biomass, consisting of acidic, neutral and alkali ones, 3% NaOH pretreatment gave the best result in terms of thallus disintegration, biomass recovery and enzymatic digestibility as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and saccharification tests. The hydrolysis of C linum feedstock with a crude specific enzyme preparation, locally produced from fermentation of Aspergillus awamori, at 45 degrees C, pH 5 for 30 h gave the maximum yield of fermentable sugar of 0.22 +/- 0.02 g/g dry substrate. An ethanol yield of 0.41 g/g reducing sugar corresponding to about 0.093 g/g pretreated algae was obtained after alcoholic fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the integrated proposed process, mycelium issued from the fungal fermentation, liquid issued from alkali pretreatment, residual from the non-hydrolysable biomass and all effluents and co-products represent a heterogeneous substrate that feed an anaerobic digester for biogas production. GC-analysis of this later showed that the biomethane yield reached 0.26 +/- 0.045 L/gVS. This study presents therefore an eco-friendly biorefining process, which efficiently coproduce bioethanol and biomethane and generate only a single waste (0.3 +/- 0.01 g/g) allowing an almost complete conversion of the algal biomass.

Performance evaluation of various bioreactors for methane fermentation of pretreated wheat straw with cattle manure,"This paper examines the performance results of configured semi-continuous mesophilic bioreactors for methane fermentation of pretreated wheat straw co-digested with cattle manure. The semi-continuous process was carried out in three different types of bioreactors, i.e. continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR), fixed film reactor (FFR), and conventional floating drum reactor (CR), with an organic loading rate of 2.2 kg of volatile solids (VS)/day. The observed results revealed that the configuration of the FFR increased the methane production yield by 41.1%. However, the configuration of the CSTR had only a marginal effect on enhancement of methane production yield (yield increased only by 10.6%) compared to the CR. The VS removal for digesters did not vary much at the same organic loading rate. The study revealed that the pretreated wheat straw with the FFR had yield methane production of 0.342 m(3)/kg VS, whereas the CSTR and CR had yield methane production of 0.289 m(3)/kg VS and 0.264 m(3)/kg VS, respectively.","Krishania, M; Vijay, VK; Chandra, R",biomethane; bioreactors; methane fermentation; pretreatment; wheat straw,2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/gps-2015-0067,Physical,mechanical desintegration,grinding,lignocellulose,wheat,straw,,,,,,,,
Effect of enzymatic pretreatment of various lignocellulosic substrates on production of phenolic compounds and biomethane potential,"Pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass is necessary to enhance the hydrolysis, which is the rate-limiting step in biogas production. Laccase and versatile peroxidase are enzymes known to degrade lignin. Therefore, the impact of enzymatic pretreatment was studied on a variety of biomass. A significant higher release in total phenolic compounds (TPC) was observed, never reaching the inhibiting values for anaerobic digestion. The initial concentration of TPC was higher in the substrates containing more lignin, miscanthus and willow. The anaerobic digestion of these two substrates resulted in a significant lower biomethane production (68.8-141.7 Nl/kg VS). Other substrates, corn stover, flax, wheat straw and hemp reached higher biomethane potential values (BMP), between 241 and 288 Nl/kg VS. Ensilaged maize reached 449 Nl/kg VS, due to the ensilation process, which can be seen as a biological and acid pretreatment.

Impact of enzymatic pretreatment on corn stover degradation and biogas production,"Corn stover is an agricultural residue consisting of lignocellulose, cellulose and hemicellulose polymers, sheeted in a lignin barrier. Corn stover can be used as feedstock for biogas production. Previous studies have shown biological pretreatment of lignocellulose materials can increase digestibility of the substrate improving hydrolysis, the rate-limiting step in biogas production. The impact of pretreating with different enzymes (laccase, manganese peroxidase and versatile peroxidase) and different incubation times, (0, 6 and 24 h) was studied. The effect on the matrix and biomethane production was determined. Pretreatments did not yield high concentrations of phenolic compounds, inhibitors of biogas production. The laccase enzyme showed an increase in biomethane production of 25% after 24 h of incubation. Pretreatment with peroxidase enzymes increased biomethane production with 17% after 6 h of incubation. As such it can be concluded that by introducing the different enzymes at different stages during pretreatment an increased biomethane production can be obtained. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Improved volatile fatty acid and biomethane production from lipid removed microalgal residue (LR mu AR) through pretreatment,"Renewable energy from lipid removed microalgal residues (LR mu ARs) serves as a promising tool for sustainable development of the microalgal biodiesel industry. Hence, in this study, LR mu AR from Ettlia sp. was characterized for its physico-biochemical parameters, and applied to various pretreatment to increase the biodegradability and used in batch experiments for the production of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and biomethane. After various pretreatments, the soluble organic matters were increased at a maximum of 82% in total organic matters in alkali-autoclaved sample. In addition, VFA and methane production was enhanced by 30% and 40% in alkali-sonicated and alkali-autoclaved samples, respectively.

Towards a metagenomic understanding on enhanced biomethane production from waste activated sludge after pH 10 pretreatment,"Background: Understanding the effects of pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of sludge waste from wastewater treatment plants is becoming increasingly important, as impetus moves towards the utilization of sludge for renewable energy production. Although the field of sludge pretreatment has progressed significantly over the past decade, critical questions concerning the underlying microbial interactions remain unanswered. In this study, a metagenomic approach was adopted to investigate the microbial composition and gene content contributing to enhanced biogas production from sludge subjected to a novel pretreatment method (maintaining pH at 10 for 8 days) compared to other documented methods (ultrasonic, thermal and thermal-alkaline). Results: Our results showed that pretreated sludge attained a maximum methane yield approximately 4-fold higher than that of the blank un-pretreated sludge set-up at day 17. Both the microbial and metabolic consortium shifted extensively towards enhanced biodegradation subsequent to pretreatment, providing insight for the enhanced methane yield. The prevalence of Methanosaeta thermophila and Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus, together with the functional affiliation of enzymes-encoding genes suggested an acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway. Additionally, an alternative enzymology in Methanosaeta was observed.

Ozonation of sewage sludge prior to anaerobic digestion led to Methanosaeta dominated biomethanation,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) of sewage sludge is commonly employed for sludge stabilization and energy generation at wastewater treatment plants. Of pretreatment techniques used to accelerate rate-limiting hydrolysis step in AD, economically feasible ozonation is prevalent and permits sludge reduction via oxidation. The stability of AD process during ozonation is crucial for successful energy recovery and needs optimal dosage that encourages methanogenic consortium efficient in methane production. This study, therefore, aimed at investigating the impact of 0.03, 0.06 and 0.09 g O3/g TSS ozone doses on the productivity of mesophilic semi-batch lab-scale 5 L AD operated at a hydraulic retention time of 15 d with organic loading rates of 1.45-1.80 g VS/L.d and on its methanogenic consortium. Measurements of biogas, methane and quantification of methanogenic consortium were done by water displacement, gas chromatography, and fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques, respectively. Although all applied ozone doses improved sludge characteristics, the highest average daily removal efficiencies with 35% COD, 32% TS, 42% VS, 60% TSS and 69% VSS were achieved through ozonation with 0.06 g O3/g TSS ozone dose. The same ozone dose also yielded 48% more methane in the biogas recovered and this biomethanation was correlated to the abundance of acetotrophic Methanosaeta species.","Tuncay, S; Akcakaya, M; Icgen, B",Anaerobic digesters; Biomethanation; Methanosaeta; Ozone pretreatment,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2021.122690,Chemical,oxidizer,ozone,activated sludge,mixed sludge,,,,,,,,,
A green pretreatment strategy using CO2 and acidogenesis liquid digestate as reagents for biomethane enhancement from corn stover,"Pretreatment is a key step for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biomethane via anaerobic digestion (AD). Though various chemical pretreatment strategies have been developed, most of them are costly and environmentally unfriendly, which seriously prevents them from practical applications. This study provides an innovative strategy that uses two kinds of AD byproducts, i.e., CO2 and acidogenesis liquid digestate (ALD), to replace conventional chemical reagents for pretreating corn stover. The effect of CO2-ALD pretreatment at different temperatures (35, 55, and 100 degrees C) on biomethane production as well as characteristics of pretreated solid and liquid products were studied. Results showed that the highest biomethane yield was obtained after using 1 Mpa CO2 in ALD at 55 degrees C pretreatment, which was 63.85% higher than the untreated sample. Meanwhile, CO2-ALD pretreatment could destroy the stubborn structure of lignocellulose and separate partially cellulose and hemicellulose, from the stover. The microbial community analysis indicated that this pretreatment strategy enhanced the abundance of hydrolytic bacteria and promoted the acetotrophic pathway. Further energy balance analysis proved that using 1 Mpa CO2 in ALD at 55.C for pretreatment had the highest energy gain (E-out/E-in), which was 30.51 % higher than that without any pretreatment.","Ma, SS; Li, LR; Ren, XR; Zhu, WB; Wang, HL",Pretreatment; Lignocellulose; Anaerobic digestion; High-pressure CO2; Acidogenesis liquid digestate,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.115844,Biological,biological active substrate,acidogenesis digestate,lignocellulose,corn,stover,,,,,,,,

"Energy Production from Cattle Manure within a Life Cycle Assessment Framework: Statistical Optimization of Co-Digestion, Pretreatment, and Thermal Conditions","Waste to energy processes from anaerobic digestion (WtE-AD) from cattle manure (CM) have low CH4 yields due to CM's structural composition. The search for alternatives to increase the energy yields of these processes must consider the optimization of operating parameters within a framework of mitigating the environmental footprint. The goal of this paper is to provide a statistical optimization strategy based on experimental designs to improve CH4 yields and reduce the environmental profile of CM valorization through a WtE-AD process. Biochemical methane potential tests were conducted to determine the energetic and environmental effects that alkaline pretreatments, different AD temperatures, and co-digestion formulations with fruit and vegetable waste (FVW) have on the WtE-AD process from CM. The evaluation was conducted following a life cycle assessment approach through energy balances. The results indicate that the highest CH4 yield (384.3 mL CH4 g VS-1) and the lowest environmental impact (-0.06 kg CO2 eq kWh(-1) of electricity production) were achieved with the co-digestion of CM with FVW 1:1, pretreatment with 10 g NaOH 100 g(-1) of VS of CM, and a temperature of 45 degrees C. It was found that the CM pretreatment with NaOH substantially increases the energy profile of the WtE-AD process without compromising the environmental impact since greenhouse gas emissions in chemical production are negligible.","Albalate-Ramirez, A; Alcala-Rodriguez, MM; Miramontes-Martinez, LR; Padilla-Rivera, A; Estrada-Baltazar, A; Lopez-Hernandez, BN; Rivas-Garcia, P",waste to energy; anaerobic digestion; pretreatment; co-digestion; operating temperature; life cycle assessment,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142416945,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,manure,cow,,,,,,,,,
Role of Lactiplantibacillus paraplantarum during anaerobic storage of ear-removed corn on biogas production,"To optimize the volatile fatty acid production for anaerobic fermentation, the ear-removed corn was ensiled without (control) or with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (LP), Lacticaseibacillus paracasei (LC) and L. paraplantarum (LpP). Inoculation of LpP increased acetic acid content by 40%, and decreased butyric acid content by 38% in relative to control. Moreover, inoculation of LpP decreased the bacterial alpha diversity indices, while inherent species of Lentilactobacillus buchneri and L. hilgardii dominated the anaerobic fermentation. In particular, inoc-ulation of LpP restricted the growth of yeasts and production of propionic acid at the early stage of storage, but continuously stimulated anaerobic fermentation, resulting in a higher maximal cumulative gas emissions of methane (by about 20 %) than that of LP and LC. Therefore, inoculation of LpP during anaerobic storage was favorable to produce intermediate metabolites (acetic acid) for subsequent biogas production of ear-removed corn.","Sun, H; Liao, CS; Lu, GR; Zheng, YL; Cheng, QM; Xie, YX; Wang, CM; Chen, C; Li, P",Agricultural byproduct; Lactic acid bacteria; Biomethane emission; Bacterial community; Pretreatment,2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.128061,Biological,anaerobic,ensilage,lignocellulose,corn,plant,,,,,,,,

Biogenic Catalysis by Adding Compost when Using Wheat Straw in a Biorefinery Concept,"The high content of lignocellulose limits the biodegradability of wheat straw for bioenergy production.

The use of compost assured the growth of cellulose-degrading anaerobic microorganisms under thermophilic conditions. Results revealed a lignocellulose material degradation in all samples.

Higher load operation by adoption of ethanol fermentation pretreatment on methane fermentation of food waste,"The study aims to examine whether ethanol fermentation pretreatment (EP) of food waste can contribute to high load operation on methane fermentation using an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). The hydraulic retention time was reduced stepwise from 20 to 5 days to increase the load by increasing the feeding volume. The corresponding organic loading rate (OLR) ranged from 6.6 to 26.5 g-COD/L/day. The control series (without pretreatment) was operable to an OLR of 8.8 g-COD/L/day versus 26.5 g-COD/L/day for the EP series. In the control series, the major volatile fatty acid (VFA) produced by acidogenesis in the reactor was propionic acid because based on Gibbs free energy variations for the methane conversion, acetic acid conversion was not as easy as from propionic acid as from ethanol in the EP series. EP proved effective in avoiding VFA accumulation and subsequent decreased pH. Therefore, EP significantly improves AnMBR performance.","Sun, J; Kosaki, Y; Watanabe, N",Biomethanation; Ethanol fermentation; Food waste; Pretreatment; Anaerobic membrane bioreactor,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.122475,Biological,anaerobic,ethanol fermentation,food waste,food waste,standard,,,,,,,,

Production of methane-rich biogas and minimization of sludge by adopting ethanol fermentation for the pretreatment of biomethanation,"In this study, the effectiveness of the ethanol fermentation pretreatment for biomethanation was examined. A sequential batch biomethanation experiment was performed for 130days using artificial food waste, which was saccharized and ethanol fermented without any evaporation of ethanol. This is compared with a control experiment without pretreatment. Methane yields of the control and pretreatment series were 420 and 460mL/g of the added volatile solids (VS) with 53% and 68% of methane content, 0.082 and 0.014g of volatile suspended solids/g VS added for sludge yield, and 87% and 94% for VS biodegradability, respectively. In terms of material balance, the generation of carbon dioxide during biomethanation from an ethanol fermented substrate is lower in volume than that without it, because carbon dioxide is released during ethanol fermentation. The lower sludge generation of the ethanol fermented substrate results from the biomass yield of ethanol and free energy obtained from the biomethanation of ethanol, which is lower than that obtained from the biomethanation of starch.","Sun, J; Kosaki, Y; Watanabe, N; Ishikawa, M",Biomethanation; Ethanol fermentation; Food waste; Pretreatment,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10163-018-0785-7,Biological,anaerobic,ethanol fermentation,food waste,food waste,standard,,,,,,,,
Effects of Sugar Beet Pulp Pretreatment Methods on Hydrogen Production by Dark Fermentation,"Methane and hydrogen generated from waste and biomass are renewable resources, which may successfully replace traditional fossil fuels.

Effects of Sugar Beet Pulp Pretreatment Methods on Hydrogen Production by Dark Fermentation,"Methane and hydrogen generated from waste and biomass are renewable resources, which may successfully replace traditional fossil fuels. This paper investigates the enhancement effect of lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment on dark fermentative hydrogen production from sugar beet pulp (SBP). The results showed that sugar beet pulp after pretreatment contained significant amounts of unfermented sugars (mainly glucose, arabinose, galactose, and raffinose), and, therefore, represented an attractive substrate for methane and hydrogen production. The greatest methane yield (495 dm3 CH4/kg VS) was achieved from sugar beet pulp after alkaline pretreatment. High methane production of up to 445 dm3 CH4/kg VS was also obtained using acidic and enzymatic hydrolysis as a preliminary treatment of the pulp. All the pretreatment methods also resulted in the enhancement of hydrogen yield with the highest value of 229 dm3 H2/kg VS achieved using acid hydrolysis compared with 17 dm3 H2/kg VS for raw material subjected to digestion.","Cieciura-Wloch, W; Borowski, S; Januszewicz, B; Domanski, J",hydrogen; methane; anaerobic digestion; dark fermentation; pretreatment,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr12081606,Chemical,alkaline,naoh,lignocellulose,sugar beet,pulp,,,,,,,,
Process design and economic evaluation for methane and electricity production from Agave bagasse using different pretreatments,"Agave bagasse is an agricultural residue that has the potential to be used as feedstock biorefineries. However, its complex structure requires a pretreatment step to facilitate the accessibility to carbohydrates for its subsequent conversion. In this study, the capital and operative expenses (CAPEX and OPEX) were simulated for industrial plants processing 500 ton/d of Agave bagasse using different pretreatment platforms for methane production and power generation on experimental data. The scenarios consisted of i) biological, ii) enzymatic, iii) dilute acid, and iv) steam explosion pretreatments and a case -based scenario without pretreatment. All these scenarios included milling, pretreatment, anaerobic digestion, and cogeneration stages. The results showed that those pretreatments carried out under soft conditions (biological and enzymatic) decreased between 2.1 and 2.8 times CAPEX compared to the highest value obtained in the diluted acid and case -based scenarios. The steam explosion, a pretreatment carried out under severe conditions, was less effective reducing CAPEX by only 1.2 times compared to the highest value. Furthermore, compared to the case -base scenario, only the biological pretreatment reduced the OPEX by a factor of 2, whereas the other pretreatments resulted in OPEX that were 2.0 to 3.5 times higher. Among the utilities (cooling water, steam generation, and energy) the steam generation contributed 47% to 76% of the total OPEX. The energy produced (kW & sdot;h/yr) was approximately twice the energy consumed for all scenarios. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the platforms since fluctuations in the prices of feedstock and raw materials did not impact the total production cost of methane, except for biological and enzymatic pretreatments. For all platforms, the solid loading was the process parameter with the highest impact on the production cost of methane. Overall, the study showed that biological and enzymatic pretreatments had the best economic performance. However, low substrate conversion and the high cost of enzymes and equipment, respectively, remained the main challenges to address in future research.","Ortíz, I; Valdez-Vazquez, I; Herández-Vázquez, A; Olivares-Hernández, R; Carrillo-Reyes, J; Alatriste-Mondragón, F; Buitrón, G; Razo-Flores, E",Pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Biomass; Biomethane; Techno-economic analysis,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2024.118319,Biological,microbial consortium,,lignocellulose,agave,bagasse,,,,,,,,

Effect of acidic pretreatment on the microstructural arrangement and anaerobic digestion of Arachis hypogea shells; and process parameters optimization using response surface methodology,"Enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulose feedstocks has been observed as the rate-limiting stage during anaerobic digestion. This necessitated the need for pretreatment before anaerobic digestion for an effective and efficient process. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of acidic pretreatment on Arachis hypogea shells, and different conditions of H2SO4 concentration, exposure time, and autoclave temperature were considered. The substrates were digested for 35 days at a mesophilic temperature to assess the impact of pretreatment on the microstructural organization of the substrate. For the purpose of examining the interactive correlations between the input parameters, response surface methodology (RSM) was used. The result reveals that acidic pretreatment has the strength to disrupt the recalcitrance features of Arachis hypogea shells and make them accessible for microorganisms' activities during anaerobic digestion. In this context, H2SO4 with 0.5% v. v-1 for 15 min at an autoclave temperature of 90 degrees C increases the cumulative biogas and methane released by 13 and 178%, respectively. The model's coefficient of determination (R2) demonstrated that RSM could model the process. Therefore, acidic pretreatment poses a novel means of total energy recovery from lignocellulose feedstock and can be investigated at the industrial scale.","Olatunji, KO; Madyira, DM",Lignocellulose; Arachis hypogea shells; Pretreatments; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; RSM,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e15145,Chemical,acidic,H2SO4,lignocellulose,Arachis hypogea,shells,,,,,,,,
Optimization of Mixed Microbes Pretreatment on Corn Straw for Enhancing Methane Production,"In order to efficiently utilize straw biomass resources, the mixed microbes were used to pretreat corn straw and anaerobic fermentation was carried out. The effects of the straw particle size, the solid-liquid ratio, and the initial pH value on both the pretreatment process and the anaerobic digestion were investigated. On the basis of single factor experiments, the pretreatment conditions were optimized using the response surface method. The pretreatment was conducted at a temperature of 30 degrees C for a duration of 15 days. The results indicated that the optimal parameters in pretreatment process were as follows: a straw particle size of 20 mesh, a solid-liquid ratio of 1:17, and an initial pH value of 6.5. The predicted cumulative methane production under these conditions was 3740 mL, while the experimental result obtained was (3805 +/- 67) mL. With a relative deviation of 1.68% between the predicted and experimental values, the model optimized the pretreatment conditions and improved the prediction of cumulative methane production.

Potential of perennial sorghum for biogas production: Pretreatment with yeast-contained inoculants during anaerobic storage,"To investigate the behind mechanism on microbial roles during anaerobic storage of forages for biogas production, inoculants with different ratios of exogenous Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were applied during anerobic storage of perennial sorghum. Yeast-contained inoculants increased biogas production of perennial sorghum by 3.81-11.70%. When the proportion of yeast in microbial inoculant increased, the lactic, acetic and butyric acid contents significantly increased (P < 0.01) across the anaerobic storage. Species of Levilactobacillus brevis was the dominant bacteria, while the growth of some pernicious fungi such as Candia and Hannaella were restricted in samples. An equal appliance of lactic acid bacteria and yeast reduced relative abundances of Weissella cibaria and L. plantarum and increased relative abundance of L. brevis of perennial sorghum. In conclusion, the appropriate inclusion of yeasts in the pretreatment process of perennial sorghum can effectively improve the pretreatment efficacy and thus increase the biogas production.","Tang, XL; Liao, CS; Zhou, SF; Chen, C; Li, L; Huang, XK; Zhang, MJ; Chen, C; Li, P",Lactic acid bacteria; Yeast; Perennial sorghum; Pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2023.130365,Biological,fungi,yeast,lignocellulose,sorghum,plant,,,,,,,,
Enhancement of Anaerobic Digestion of Corn Straw: Effect of Biological Pretreatment and Heating with Bio-Heat Recovery from Pretreatment,"Biological pretreatment can promote the degradation of biomass and enhance methane production via the subsequent anaerobic digestion. In addition, a large amount of bio-heat can be generated during the pretreatment process to provide heat for the anaerobic digestion process. In this study, composite microorganisms were employed for pretreating corn straw. The impact of different pretreatment times and the heat generated by the pretreatment process on subsequent anaerobic digestion were studied. The results show that the maximum temperature of the pretreatment process was 56.2 degrees C, obtained on day 6. After 14 days of pretreatment, the degradation rate of the pretreatment group increased by 41% compared with the control group. As a consequence, straws with different pretreatment times were used for anaerobic digestion. The group that underwent 6 days of pretreatment and utilized bio-heat generated from pretreatment achieved the highest cumulative methane production of 401.58 mL/g VS, which was 60.13% higher than in the control group without pretreatment. After 6 days of composite microorganism pretreatment, the group that utilized bio-heat achieved a 29.08% increase in cumulative methane production compared to the group that did not utilize bio-heat. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of biological pretreatment with composite microorganisms followed by anaerobic digestion using bio-heat as an effective method for treating corn straw.","Guan, SY; He, C; Li, PF; Li, PP; Hou, TT; Gao, Z; Li, G; Jiao, YZ",composite microorganisms; pretreatment; bio-heat; anaerobic digestion,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation10030160,Biological,microbial consortium,mixed,lignocellulose,corn,straw,,,,,,,,
Enhancing the Methane Yield of Salicornia spp. via Organosolv Fractionation as Part of a Halophyte Biorefinery Concept,"The present research investigated the effect of organosolv pretreatment on two species of salt-tolerant Salicornia spp. biomass, Salicornia dolichostachya and Salicornia ramosissima, for increasing biomethane production through anaerobic digestion. The final biomethane yield of de-juiced green fibers of Salicornia spp. from wet fractionation increased by 23-28% after organosolv treatment. The highest methane yield of about 300 mL-CH4/gVS was found after organosolv treatment with 60% v/v ethanol solution at 200 degrees C for 30 min, or at 180 degrees C for 30 or 60 min treatment time. Furthermore, the methane production rate increased significantly, reducing the time until 95% of the final methane yield was reached from 20 days to 6-10 days for the organosolv-treated biomass. This research shows that the process of anaerobic digestion of halophyte biomass benefits from cascade processing of Salicornia fibers in a biorefinery framework by sequential wet and organosolv fractionation for full utilization of halophytic biomass.","Cayenne, A; Monçao, M; Matsakas, L; Rova, U; Christakopoulos, P; Thomsen, MH; Uellendahl, H",anaerobic digestion; organosolv pretreatment; methane production; biorefinery,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en17051074,Chemical,solvent,organosolv,lignocellulose,salicornia,plant,,,,,,,,
Effect of Pretreatments on the Production of Biogas from Castor Waste by Anaerobic Digestion,"Lignocellulosic biomass is a source of carbohydrates that can be used in the production of biogas.

Enhanced anaerobic digestion of freezing and thawing pretreated cow manure with increasing solid content: kinetics and microbial community dynamics,"High solid anaerobic digestion has proved the mainstream technology for the treatment of organic wastes. However, the high molecular weight and complex lignocellulosic structure of cow manure (CM) make it indigestible and inefficient, leading to limit the hydrolysis step of anaerobic digestion at high solid content. To mitigate this bottleneck, an improved cost-effective freezing and thawing pretreatment technique was proposed in this study. The freezing and thawing pretreatment of raw CM without any dilution was done for 20 days. The maximum cumulative methane yield (487 mL CH4 g- 1VS) was achieved at a total solid (TS) of 5% followed by TS of 10% and 15%, which was 13%, 20% and 21% higher than obtained from untreated CM, respectively. The kinetic results revealed that the biodegradable materials could be utilized at increasing TS with decreasing hydrolysis rate. The pretreatment significantly enhanced the methylotrophic methanogenic pathway during high solid anaerobic digestion, which was contrary to the general concept that the process is usually dominated by acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. This study is very important to understand the effect of solid content but also important to understand the effect of freezing and thawing pretreatment on process parameters and microbial community dynamics in high solid anaerobic digestion.","Abid, M; Wu, J; Yan, YY; Ajmal, Z; Mehmood, T; Husnain, SN; Zhou, X",Pretreatment; High solid anaerobic digestion; Biomethane; Microbiology; Methanogenic pathways,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-76392-z,Physical,freezing,,manure,cow,,,,,,,,,
"Combining sulfite and freezing/thawing pretreatment to simultaneously improves methanogenesis, dewaterability, and pathogen inactivation of waste activated sludge: Depicting sulfite migration during ice crystal growth","Harmless treatment of waste activated sludge (WAS) is the primary goal for sludge management while bioresource recovery is raising wide scholarly and industrial interest due to the abundant resource potential in WAS. This study employed sulfite and freezing/thawing to pretreat WAS for its versatility in simultaneously enhancing methane production, improving dewaterability, and inactivating pathogenic microorganisms. The addition of 100 mg S/L of sulfite and subsequent freezing/thawing significantly promoted the release of organics from a low organic-contained WAS (volatile solid/total solid = 0.4), leading to a substantial increase in methane production by 10.99 %. The combined pretreatment significantly reduced the capillary suction time of sludge by 77.24 % and effectively inactivated pathogenic microorganisms to below detectable levels. From a micro level, sulfur aggregation was observed around sludge particles, which can be attributed to the process of ice formation. During this process, sulfite was continuously transferred to the aqueous phase surrounding the particles where were froze even slower. Moreover, the formation of capillary water ice crystals further compromised the protective function of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on sludge cells.

pH and Heat Pretreatments with Zero-Valent Iron Addition to Enhance Biogas Production from Cassava Pulp Wastewater: Optimization and Comparison of Mathematical Models,"Pretreatments of pH and heat with zero-valent iron (ZVI) additions enhance anaerobic digestion and increase reducing sugar availability for optimum biogas production. This study aimed to optimize the conditions of different pH and heat pretreatment with additional ZVI to yield higher biogas amounts from the anaerobic digestion (AD) of cassava wastewater. Thirteen pH conditions, ten ZVI concentrations, and eleven heating periods were varied and measured to optimize the standard conditions. Four mathematical models that are widely used to evaluate the cumulative biogas production were employed, namely, the Modified Gompertz, Logistic, Transference, and Exponential models. The pretreatment of pH 10 and 35 min of boiling time with a ZVI concentration of 60 g & BULL;kg & BULL;TVS-1 produced the highest cumulative biogas at the end of the AD process. The Logistic and Modified Gompertz models were better fitted with the experimental data than the other models. Interestingly, the optimized conditions altered the biogas production rate but prolonged the lag phase. A reasonably positive correlation was also found between the FeOOH amount and biogas production rate in the LF and MG models. These optimal fitted models, kinetics parameters, and possible correlations are novel findings that can help develop extensive scale developments for biogas generation from cassava wastewater.","Boontian, N; Yingchon, U; Padri, M",anaerobic digestion; pretreatments; zero-valent iron; mathematical models; biogas production,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation9070622,Process improvement,nanoparticles,ZVI,lignocellulose,cassava,processing waste,,,,,,,,
Construction of a Synthetic Microbial Community for Enzymatic Pretreatment of Wheat Straw for Biogas Production via Anaerobic Digestion,"Biological pretreatment is a viable method for enhancing biogas production from straw crops, with the improvement in lignocellulose degradation efficiency being a crucial factor in this process. Herein, a metagenomic approach was used to screen core microorganisms (Bacillus subtilis, Acinetobacter johnsonii, Trichoderma viride, and Aspergillus niger) possessing lignocellulose-degrading abilities among samples from three environments: pile retting wheat straw (WS), WS returned to soil, and forest soil. Subsequently, synthetic microbial communities were constructed for fermentation-enzyme production. The crude enzyme solution obtained was used to pretreat WS and was compared with two commercial enzymes. The synthetic microbial community enzyme-producing pretreatment (SMCEP) yielded the highest enzymatic digestion efficacy for WS, yielding cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin degradation rates of 39.85, 36.99, and 19.21%, respectively. Furthermore, pretreatment of WS with an enzyme solution, followed by anaerobic digestion achieved satisfactory results. SMCEP displayed the highest cumulative biogas production at 801.16 mL/g TS, which was 38.79% higher than that observed for WS, 22.15% higher than that of solid-state commercial enzyme pretreatment and 25.41% higher than that of liquid commercial enzyme pretreatment. These results indicate that enzyme-pretreated WS can significantly enhance biogas production. This study represents a solution to the environmental burden and energy use of crop residues.","Chen, JM; Cai, YF; Wang, Z; Wang, ST; Li, J; Song, C; Zhuang, W; Liu, D; Wang, SL; Song, AD; Xu, JL; Ying, HJ",wheat straw; metagenomics; enzyme pretreatment; anaerobic digestion; biogas production,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c02789,Biological,enzyme,crude,lignocellulose,wheat,straw,,,,,,,,
Processing of Agricultural Residues with a High Concentration of Structural Carbohydrates into Biogas Using Selective Biological Products,"Biomass, particularly agricultural residues and biomass rich in structural carbohydrates, offers significant potential for sustainable biogas production. Biological pretreatment using microorganisms, particularly Trichoderma species, is discussed as a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable approach to improving the decomposition of structural carbohydrates into fermentable sugars. This study aimed to assess the impact of employing a selective biological product (BP) on the biogas production process and biomethane potential using winter wheat straw (WWS) as a representative feedstock. The biological product, consisting of microorganisms of the Trichoderma spp. genus, was introduced to enhance microbial activity. The biogas potential results showed that WWS treated with the BP exhibited a remarkable improvement in biogas production. Specifically, biogas yield increased from 364.1 L/kg of mass in untreated straw to 439.9 L/kg in BP-treated straw, representing a substantial 20.8% increase. Furthermore, in continuous loading tests, the steady-state biogas yield from BP-treated straw ranged from 553.6 to 582.0 L/kg VS, which was notably higher compared to untreated straw with a yield of 490.0 L/kg VS. Overall, the results of this study demonstrated that the application of selective biological products significantly enhanced biogas production and biomethane potential from structural carbohydrates containing biomass sources.","Venslauskas, K; Navickas, K; Rubezius, M; Zalys, B; Gegeckas, A",straw; anaerobic digestion; sustainable biomass pretreatment; biogas; fungi; Trichoderma,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16041553,Biological,fungi,trichoderma,lignocellulose,wheat,straw,,,,,,,,
Comparative evaluation of the effect of ultrasonic pretreatment at different temperatures on enhancing anaerobic digestion of rumen wastes,"The aim of this study was to determine the most appropriate treatment for the duration of ultrasonic pretreatment at two different temperatures in the process of anaerobic digestion (AD) of ruminal contents in the slaughterhouse. The experiments were performed at the Golshan industrial slaughterhouse in Lorestan province. In this study, after homogenizing the rumen contents of different animals, the effect of ultrasonic pretreatment time at three different intervals of 10, 20, and 30 min at two different temperatures of 30 degrees C and 40 degrees C was investigated to determine the effect of variables related to the trend of changes in methane, total biogas, and daily biogas production. The Taguchi L18 method was used to investigate the process conditions and achieve optimal production conditions for biogas methane. The results showed that with an increase in pretreatment time up to 30 min and the temperature up to 40 degrees C, the production of biogas and methane also increased. The highest amount of methane, total biogas, and daily biogas produced was related to the use of ultrasonic pretreatment for 30 min at 40 degrees C with 50.66 % methane, total biogas production of 332.66 mL/gVS, and the best performance compared to other treatments in the shortest possible time. Therefore, the use of ultrasonic pretreatment over longer periods and at higher temperatures improves the AD process and produces more total methane and biogas. Finally, this research presented equations for the production of biogas and methane at a time of 10-30 min and a temperature of 30-40 degrees C, which showed high accuracy.","Kooshki, A; Almassi, M; Ghahderijani, M; Shamloui, HR",Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Pretreatment; Slaughterhouse waste; Ultrasonic,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jics.2023.101115,Physical,ultrasonic,,animal byproduct,intestine,,,,,,,,,
Optimization of methane production from solid tuna waste: Thermal pretreatment and co-digestion,"Fish canning industries generate large amounts of solid waste during their processing operations, creating a significant environmental challenge. Nonetheless, this waste can be efficiently and sustainably treated through anaerobic digestion. In this study, the potential of biogas production from anaerobic digestion of thermally pretreated and co-digested solid tuna waste was investigated. The thermal pretreatment of raw fish viscera resulted in a 50 % increase in methane yield, with a production of 0.27 g COD-CH4/g COD added. However, this pretreatment did not lead to a significant increase in biogas production for cooked tuna viscera. When non-thermally pretreated raw viscera was tested, a large accumulation of volatile fatty acids and long chain fatty acids was observed, with levels reaching 21 and 6 g COD/L, respectively. On the other hand, anaerobic co-digestion of cooked tuna viscera with fat waste significantly enhanced methane production, achieving 0.87 g COD-CH4/g COD added. In contrast, co-digestion of cooked tuna viscera with dairy waste and sewage sludge resulted in notably lower yields of 0.36 and 0.46 g COD-CH4/g COD added, respectively. These results may be related to the C/N ratio, which was found to be within the optimal range for anaerobic digestion only in the tuna and fat waste co-digestion assay.","Bermúdez-Penabad, N; Rodríguez-Montes, A; Alves, M; Kennes, C; Veiga, MC",Anaerobic digesti ' on; Thermal pretreatment; Tuna waste; Fat waste; Methane,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2024.01.050,Physical,thermal,,animal byproduct,tuna,waste,,,,,,,,
Green and chemical-free pretreatment of corn straw using cold isostatic pressure for methane production,"In this study, the effect of cold isostatic pressure (CIP) pretreatment on the physicochemical properties and subsequent anaerobic digestion (AD) performance of corn straw (CS) was explored. The CS was subjected to CIP pretreatment by pressures of 200, 400 and 600 MPa, respectively, while AD was carried out at medium temperature (35 & PLUSMN; 2 & DEG;C). The results showed that CIP pretreatment disrupted the dense structure of the CS and altered the crystallinity index and surface hydrophobicity of the CS, thereby affecting the AD process. The presence of CIP pretreatment increased the initial reducing sugar concentration by 0.11-0.27 g/L and increased the maximum volatile fatty acids content by 112.82-436.64 mg/L, which facilitated the process of acidification and hydrolysis of the AD. It was also observed that the CIP pretreatment maintained the pH in the range of 6.37-7.30, maintaining the stability of the overall system. Moreover, the cumulative methane production in the CIP pretreatment group increased by 27.17 %-64.90 % compared to the control group. Analysis of the microbial results showed that CIP pretreatment increased the abundance of cellulose degrading bacteria Ruminofilibacter from 21.50 % to 27.53 % and acetoclastic methanogen Methanosaeta from 45.48 % to 56.92 %, thus facilitating the hydrolysis and methanogenic stages. The energy conversion analysis showed that CIP is a green and non-polluting pretreatment strategy for the efficient AD of CS to methane.","Yang, JC; Chen, RJ; Zhang, QG; Zhang, LH; Li, QC; Zhang, ZY; Wang, YX; Qu, B",Corn straw; Anaerobic digestion; Cold isostatic pressure; Pretreatment; Microbial diversity,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165442,Physical,pressure,,lignocellulose,corn,straw,,,,,,,,
Improving Methane Production from Waste Activated Sludge Assisted by Fe(II)-Activated Peroxydisulfate Pretreatment via Anaerobic Digestion: Role of Interspecific Syntrophism Mediated by Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria,"Sulfate radical generated via peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation has been extensively applied to energy recovery from waste activated sludge (WAS) during anaerobic digestion (AD), while the residual sulfate is still a limitation for its further application. In this study, a novel coupling strategy of Fe(II)activated PDS pretreatment [Fe(II)_PDS] with sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) mediated was explored to enhance methane yield from WAS during AD. Results showed that the similar methane yield was obtained in Fe(II)_PDS + SRB (16.6 mL/g VSS) and zero-valent iron (ZVI)_PDS + SRB (16.9 mL/g VSS), which enhanced by 19.9-56.5% than other groups, while the hydrolysis rate constant (0.0065 h-1) in Fe(II)_PDS + SRB was much higher than that observed in ZVI_PDS + SRB (0.0046 h-1). Meanwhile, the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) peaked at 360.9 mg COD/g VSS (5 d) in the Fe(II)_PDS + SRB group, with the acetic acid (HAc) and propionic acid (HPr) accumulative proportion of 73.5%, and the total concentration promoted by 28.5% than that of the ZVI_PDS + SRB group, which provided a more ideal substrate for methanogens. The ultimate utilization efficiency of SCFAs reached 62.4% in the Fe(II)_PDS + SRB group. Moreover, MiSeq sequencing, canonical correspondence analysis, and molecular ecological network analysis revealed the intrinsic interaction of the functional microbial consortia, that is, anaerobic fermentation bacteria, SRB, nitrate-reducing bacterium, and acetotrophic methanogen, with the abundances of 9.52, 2.4, 4.93, and 77.7% in the Fe(II)_PDS + SRB group. Considering the treatment performance and the difficulty of the subsequent disposal, Fe(II) may be the superior activator than ZVI for free radicals (i.e., SO4 center dot- and HO center dot) generation from PDS and further played the important role for interspecific syntrophism coupling with SRB during AD. Results of this study may provide a promising way for energy recovery from WAS.","Cui, ZX; Liu, ZH; Fan, YX; He, ZW; Liu, WZ; Yue, XP; Zhou, AJ",persulfate pretreatment; Fe(II); anaerobic digestion; sulfate-reducing bacteria; methane,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c06686,Process improvement,nanoparticles,zvi,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Effects of Hydrothermal Pretreatment and Anaerobic Digestion of Pig Manure on the Antibiotic Removal and Methane Production,"Whether advanced biological waste treatment technologies, such as hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) integrated anaerobic digestion (AD), could enhance the removal of different antibiotics remains unclear. This study investigated the outcome of antibiotics and methane productivity during pig manure treatment via HTP, AD, and HTP + AD. Results showed improved removal efficiency of sulfadiazine (SDZ), oxytetracycline (OTC), and enrofloxacin (ENR) with increased HTP temperatures (70, 90, 120, 150, and 170 degrees C). OTC achieved the highest removal efficiency of 86.8% at 170 degrees C because of its high sensitivity to heat treatment. For AD, SDZ exhibited resistance with a removal efficiency of 52.8%. However, OTC and ENR could be removed completely within 30 days. When HTP was used prior to AD, OTC and ENR could achieve complete removal. However, residual SDZ levels reduced to 20% and 16% at 150 and 170 degrees C, respectively. The methanogenic potential showed an overall upward trend as the HTP temperature increased. Microbial analysis revealed the antibiotics-induced enrichment of specific microorganisms during AD. Firmicutes were the dominant bacterial phylum, with their abundance positively correlated with the addition of antibiotics. Methanobacterium and Methanosarcina emerged as the dominant archaea that drove methane production during AD. Thus, HTP can be a potential pretreatment before AD to reduce antibiotic-related risks in manure waste handling.","Guo, CC; Ma, YF; Li, YT; Wang, ZW; Lin, SP; Dong, RJ; Liu, S",Pig manure; Oxytetracycline; Enrofloxacin; Sulfadiazine; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-024-04900-y,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,manure,pig,,,,,,,,,
Super diluted mixture alkali (SDMA) pretreatment for cornstalk anaerobic Digestion: A green strategy for High-Solid biogas production,"Biogas production from lignocellulose by anaerobic digestion has made significant progress lately.

The system stability was verified by a scaleup experiment in a 10 L bioreactor. Remarkably, the entire process does not generate any wastewater or chemical pollution.

Enhancing kitchen waste anaerobic digestion by recycled aluminum industry waste: Alkali treatment and potential electron transfer mechanism,"Kitchen waste has become a significant environmental concern worldwide. Red mud, an industrial solid waste characterized by its porous structure and high iron oxide content, exhibits potential as a conductive conduit in the direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) pathway. In this study, red mud pretreatment of kitchen waste was conducted to enhance anaerobic digestion (AD). The effect and mechanism of enhancing kitchen waste AD by red mud pretreatment was studied for the first time. Results indicated that red mud pretreatment could accelerate the hydrolysis of organic compounds and alleviate the acid inhibition. Consequently, the methane production rate was increased from 260.7 mL/g VS to 402.3 mL/g VS, i.e., up to 54.3%. And volatile solids removal efficiency was increased from 53.9% to 73.1%, i.e., up to 35.6%. Furthermore, microbial community analysis revealed the enrichment of electrochemically active bacteria (Synergistaceae), acetogenic bacteria (Syntrophomonadaceae) and methanogens (Methanobacterium and Methanosarcina), which played essential roles in interspecies hydrogen transfer (IHT) and DIET. This study showed that red mud pretreatment has the potential to enhance kitchen waste AD which contributes to carbon mitigation. It also threw the potential new insights to the relative mechanism.","Zhang, SH; Hu, YY; Fu, NX; Wu, J; Wei, Q; Wang, XF; Wang, X; Hu, FP",Kitchen waste; Red mud; Anaerobic digestion; Pretreatment; Microbial community,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2024.112409,Process improvement,desinhibition,red mud,food waste,kitchen waste,standard,,,,,,,,
Effect of indirect electrochemical pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion of swine manure,"The increase in pig population has led to an accumulation of swine manure (SM) in the environment. Improper disposal of this waste can lead to environmental pollution. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a promising method for utilizing SM, but its industrial application is still limited due to high lignocellulose content and a suboptimal carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. In this study, indirect electrochemical pretreatment (IEP) was used to improve AD of SW. IEP involves treating SM with reactive oxygen species generated by tap water electrolysis. Three different pretreatment modes (acidic-alkaline, acidic, and alkaline-acidic-alkaline) were tested, differing in the time of water flow through the electrochemical unit of the IEP device. Using scanning electron microscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopy, it was found that as a result of IEP, the particle size of the SM decreased from 200 to 500 to 15-50 mu m. This led to an increase in biodegradability by 37-38%, compared to untreated SM. Using the alkaline-acidalkaline pretreatment mode, the highest methane yield of 94.48 +/- 1.42 mL CH4/g VS was obtained, which was 41.28 +/- 2.21% higher than in the control group. During AD of pretreated SM, more complex microbial aggregates were observed in the anaerobic microbial community, and the relative abundance of hydrolytic (Bacillus, Ureibacillus, and Geobacillus genera) and syntrophic (Smithella genus and Christensenellaceae R-7 group) microorganisms increased.","Ivanenko, AA; Laikova, AA; Zhuravleva, EA; Shekhurdina, SV; Loiko, NG; Kotova, IB; Kovalev, AA; Kovalev, DA; Panchenko, VA; Mamedov, SE; Litti, YV",Hydrogen; Anaerobic digestion; Indirect electrochemical pretreatment; Biomethane; Swine manure,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.11.184,Physical,electrolysis,,manure,pig,,,,,,,,,
Effect of aeration pretreatment on anaerobic digestion of swine manure,"To investigate the effects of aeration pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion (AD) of swine manure, five pretreatment groups were established with dissolved oxygen (DO) in each group set to 0.0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.4, and 2.0 mg/L, respectively. The results demonstrated that compared to the non-aeration group, methane production increased to varying degrees with different aeration pretreatments (AP), with a maximum increase of 27.98% (DO = 2.0 mg/L). AP reduced the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) content of biogas. The H2S concentration in the DO = 2.0 mg/L was only 0.209%, and this represented an increased H2S removal rate of 49.27% compared to that of the DO = 0.0 mg/L (0.412%). Simultaneously, AP increases the hydrolysis rate. When the DO concentration reached 2.0 mg/L, the hydrolysis rate reached its maximum. An increase in the hydrolysis rate further enhanced the removal rate of organic matter. The organic matter removal rate was highest (36.96%) at DO = 2.0 mg/L. AP effectively prolonged the methane generation time and shortened the lag time of methane generation. AP creates a brief micro aerobic environment, accelerates substrate hydrolysis, and promotes the production and consumption of total volatile fatty acids, particularly acetic acid. Additionally, AP promoted the symbiotic relationship between Caldicoprobacter (20.93%-34.96%) and Metanosaeta (14.73%-18.45%).

Enhancing Mesophilic Anaerobic Digestion of Waste-Activated Sludge through Heat Pretreatment and Kinetic Modeling,"Sewage sludge is a useful raw material for the production of renewable energy due to its stable annual output. In this study, the enhancement of mesophilic anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge through heat pretreatment at 95 degree celsius for 30 min was tested in an anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactor (hAMBBR). The sludge retention time was set at 20, 15, 10, and 5 days during 300 days of operation and compared to a traditional anaerobic continuous stirred tank reactor (AnCSTR) without pretreatment. Results of this research indicate that the digestion ratio of volatile soluble solids in the hAMBBR process could be improved by 50%, and the average conversion ratio of methane could be increased by 45%. When the sludge retention time (SRT) was shortened to 5 days, the methane production approached twice that of the contrast reactor. The expanded anaerobic digestion model, including activated sludge models, was utilized for operation simulation. The effect of sludge retention time (SRT) shortening on volatile suspended solids (VSS) digestibility and methane production was well reproduced with simulations. The research conclusion reveals the impact of pretreatment and reactor types on anaerobic digestion and provides the scientific basis for improving methane production and process efficiency in anaerobic digestion.","Wang, J; Liu, B; Chen, FY; Li, YF; Xu, BJ; Zhang, RA; Goel, R; Terashima, M; Yasui, H",sewage sludge; anaerobic digestion; heat pretreatment; kinetic model,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15075985,Physical,thermal,,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Thermal hydrolysis pretreatment of wastewater biosolids: Modelling the impact of the aerobic sludge age,"This study investigates the impact of thermal hydrolysis pretreatment (THP) on the characteristics of wastewater biosolids, methane production, anaerobic biodegradability, and recycled sidestream nitrogen loads, as a function of the sludge age of the activated sludge (AS) system through a series of BioWin simulations of 3 different process configurations at sludge ages of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 60 d, with and without thermal hydrolysis. BioWin's anaerobic digester and thermal hydrolysis units were calibrated by adopting and identifying various kinetic and operational parameters from the available literature and through series of full-scale plant simulations. Thermal hydrolysis improved the hydrolysis rates of the biosolids by 181%. Improvements in anaerobic biodegradability, mainly due to the conversion of endogenous products, ranged from 14% to 67% at sludge ages of 5-15 d. At sludge ages of 20-60 d, anaerobic biodegradability improved by 59% to 186% depending on the process configuration. At sludge ages of 15-60 d, methane production was relatively stable and insensitive to the biosolids composition. Despite the increase in the recycled nitrogen load by 42% to 127%, it only constituted 13% of the influent nitrogen load. Effluent ammonia concentrations remained unchanged and effluent nitrates concentrations only increased by 1.4 to 2 mg N/L, maintaining effluent standards without additional sidestream treatment.","Ismail, A; Elbeshbishy, E; Nakhla, G",Thermal hydrolysis pretreatment; Modelling; Endogenous products; Anaerobic digestion; Sludge age; Biodegradability,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jwpe.2024.105114,Physical,thermal,,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Enhanced biogas production from rice straw through pretreatment with cellulase producing microbial consortium,"Rice straw (RS) is a rich lignocellulosic biomass that can be employed for biogas generation through anaerobic digestion. However, lignin-silica encrustation around the holocellulose complex hinders its digestibility. Therefore, in this present study, RS was biologically pretreated with microbial consortium of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU decomposer), which is composed of Bacillus sp., Delftia sp., Pseudomonas sp., Lysinibacillus fusiform, Arthrobacter nicotianae, Paenibaccilus ehimensis, Aspergillus sp. and Trichoderma sp. Bio-digested slurry, the underutilized spent waste from cattle dung-based biogas plants was used as a growth medium for the mass multiplication of consortium. Soaked and chopped RS was pretreated with consortium and individual cultures in triplicate sets for 5 and 10 d and were analyzed for biochemical parameters along with cellulolytic activity. The pretreated straw was used for biogas production in 2 L capacity anaerobic digesters. Cellulolytic activities i.e., endoglucanase (0.071 IU/mL), exoglucanase (0.027 IU/mL) and beta-glucosidase (3.734 IU/mL) of consortium treated RS were higher as compared to untreated RS. Biogas production from consortium pretreated RS was 187.45 L/kg RS which is 45.93% more as compared to untreated RS with 128.45 L/kg RS of biogas. This could be attributed to the synergistic cellulolytic activities of PAU decomposer leading to enhanced biogas production from RS.","Sahil, S; Karvembu, P; Kaur, R; Katyal, P; Phutela, UG",Rice straw; Consortium; Anaerobic digestion; Pretreatment; Enzyme; Biogas,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nexus.2023.100246,Biological,enzyme,,lignocellulose,rice,straw,,,,,,,,
Hydrothermal pretreatment of protein-rich substrate: Modified phsiochemical properties and consequent responses in its anaerobic digestion,"Wasted tofu rich in protein was subject to hydrothermal pretreatment (HTPT) under different conditions (at 120, 140, 160 and 180 degrees C; for 0, 30, 60 and 90 min) followed by biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests, and 140 degrees C and 0 min were found to be respectively the best temperature and duration for HTPT of tofu in terms of its biogas production. Under the under the optimal conditions (140 degrees C, 0 min) the accumulative methane yield reached up to 510.9 mL center dot(gVS)(-1), which was 26.98 % higher than that without HTPT (402.3 mL center dot(gVS)(-1)). The start-up process of continuous anerobic digestion (AD) of the tofu before and after hydrothermal treated (HT) at the optimal HTPT conditions (140 degrees C, 0 min) was examined, to investigate and compare how their consequent AD responded to HTPT. It was found that, for start-up of continuous AD, the HT tofu delivered more balanced nutrients and thus led to more stable AD and quicker biogas production. Unavoidably, HTPT generated products refractory to biodegradation, to slightly decrease the total biogas production. During AD of HT tofu some weak ammonia-tolerant microbes, such as methylotrophic methanogens, survived and played indispensable roles. Analyses of living microbial community structure indicated that, some hydrolytic acidification bacteria intol-erant to ammonia nitrogen (such as Proteobacteria) were always active and appeared at high proportion. The viable methylotrophic methanogens, e. g. RumEn M2, took obvious responsibilities in start-up of the AD for HT tofu.","Qiao, F; Zhang, GY; Fan, J; Zhang, H; Shi, BW; Yang, JC; Zhang, JL; Han, ZN",Hydrothermal pretreatment (HTPT); Protein-rich substrate; Anaerobic digestion (AD); Biogas; Microbial community structure,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crcon.2022.10.001,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,food waste,tofu,waste,,,,,,,,
Effect of hydrothermal pretreatment on leachate fed Scenedesmus sp. biomass solubilization and biogas production,"The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of hydrothermal pretreatment on the solubilization and anaerobic digestion (AD) of Scenedesmus sp. biomass. At first, the microalgae was cultivated in 5% fresh leachate (FL) to recover nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Scenedesmus sp. grown in 5% FL obtained 100%, 77% and 97% removal efficiency of ammonium nitrogen (NH4+ - N), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and phosphate phosphorous (PO43- -P), respectively. In the following step, the hydrothermal pretreatment of Scenedesmus sp. biomass was carried out at 120, 150 and 170 degrees C and retention time of 0, 30 and 60 min to evaluate its solubilization and biogas production through AD in batch test. Soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) increased by 260% compared to untreated microalgae at 170 degrees C for 60 min. In comparison to untreated microalgae, the highest increase in biogas (70%) and methane yield (100%) was observed for 150 degrees C and 60 min pretreated microalgae as a consequence of hydrothermal pretreatment. Hydrothermal pretreatment has shown effectiveness in enhancing biomass solubilization and increasing biogas yield. Nevertheless, further research at the pilot scale is necessary to thoroughly evaluate the potential and feasibility of hydrothermal pretreatment for full-scale implementation.","Saleem, S; Ullah, Z; Rashid, N; Sheikh, Z",Fresh leachate; Nutrient removal; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Microalgae solubilization; Anaerobic digestion,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121515,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,micro-algae,scenedesmus,,,,,,,,,
New insight of combined hydrothermal and ultrasonic pretreatment for methane production from anaerobic digestion of food waste,"Food waste (FW) biotransformation into bioenergy has garnered a lot of scientific interest as a way to address the energy crisis and trash disposal issues. FW is converted into biogas, a gaseous combination of biomethane and carbon dioxide. In order to valorize FW, anaerobic digestion (AD) with combined pretreatment (hydrothermal (HT) and ultrasonic (US)) is used as a potential method. Three digesters were investigated: the control (unpretreated), HT(121 degrees C) + US, and HT(134 degrees C) + US, respectively. Based on changes in the combined pretreatment conditions, the paper assessed the methane productivity. Furthermore, kinetic modeling was evaluated with six kinetic models. The results show that the HT pretreatment at 121 degrees C combined with US improves the volatile solid (VS) removal to 73 +/- 5% and the methane yield to 529.7 +/- 11 NmL/gVS. Both the Transference model and the first order have the greatest fits in terms of R2, and they also have the best fits in terms of relative errors, and methane production rate, respectively.

Effects of different thermal and thermochemical pretreatments on the anaerobic digestion of algal biomass cultivated in urban wastewater and collected with and without chemical coagulants,"Algal biomass cultivated in wastewater treatment systems is a promising feedstock for biogas production through anaerobic digestion. However, its rigid cell wall inhibits the hydrolysis of intracellular substances and limits its anaerobic digestibility. To improve anaerobic biodegradability, this study investigated the effects of different thermal and thermochemical pretreatments on the performance of anaerobic digestion of the obtained biomass. High-rate algal ponds fed with UASB effluent treating domestic sewage were used to grow algal biomass. Two methods were used for biomass harvesting: a physical method, through filtration, and a physico-chemical method, using coagulants, Tanfloc SL and Aluminum Sulfate (Al-2(SO4)(3)). Three types of biomasses were obtained, one without coagulant (AB-P), one with Tanfloc (AB-T), and one with Al-2(SO4)(3) (AB-AS), which were subjected to different thermal and thermochemical pretreatments. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis confirmed the effectiveness of the pretreatment methods, showing modifications in the structures of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids in the microalgae cells. The alkaline thermochemical pretreatment (90 degrees C-3 h-pH 11) of AB-AS resulted in higher organic matter solubilization, with a 32 % increase in soluble COD. This pretreatment also resulted in the highest biogas yield, producing 460.64 mL CH4.gVS(-1), with a 229 % increase, and the highest maximum production rate, with Rmax = 78.98 mL CH4.gVS(-1).day(-1). Acidic thermochemical pretreatments that resulted in biomass with pH <= 4.2 inhibited biogas production. In terms of energy, the best pretreatment was 78 degrees C-7 h on AB-P, with an EROI of 2.20, which demonstrates a surplus of energy. These findings underscore the potential for optimizing the anaerobic digestibility of algal biomass, thus contributing to more efficient and sustainable biogas production.","Estevam, R; Gonçalves, RF; Oss, RN; Sampaio, ICF; Cassini, ST",Algal biomass; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Thermal pretreatment; Thermochemical pretreatment; Urban wastewater,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2024.103417,Physical,thermal,,micro-algae,pond,,,,,,,,,

Effect of pretreatment with efficient microorganisms on anaerobic digestion of rice drying residue,"Rice drying generates large amounts of impurities which has been previously studied for biogas production with unfavorable results due to its high lignocellulosic content. This research aimed to assess the effect of the pretreatment and bioaugmentation with efficient microorganisms on the anaerobic digestion of rice dry -ing residue, and the kinetics of methane production. For the study, rice drying residues were pretreated for 48 hours with efficient microorganisms diluted 1:100, in a relation of 18 mL gVS-1 of substrate; while for bioaugmentation microorganisms were added directly to the reactors. The kinetic behavior of the digestion process was described through four models of first and second order. The highest methane yield was obtained with pretreated residues (363.7 LNkgVS-1), being 9.9% higher than that of the substrate without pretreatment. Bioaugmentation did not show significant differences. All the models fitted well with the experimental cumu-lative methane yield data, but the Hill modified model had the best fit in all cases. The study shows that the use of efficient microorganisms is an attractive option to increase waste degradation in anaerobic digestion processes.","Negrin, AME; González, LL; Hernández, JJ",Anaerobic digestion; Efficient microorgan-isms; Pretreatment; Rice drying residue,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.55815/422397,Biological,microbial consortium,me50,lignocellulose,rice,plant,,,,,,,,
Effect of surfactant on microwave pretreatment of sago waste for cost effective biomethane production,"The disintegration of sago waste by energy intensive microwave pretreatment was not profitable to achieve the desirable solubilization for biogas recovery. This limitation makes the microwave-assisted pretreatment of sago waste to be less effective. Therefore, in the present study, microwave-assisted sago waste pretreatment was coupled with surfactant to enhance the solubilization for cost effective biofuel production. At optimal microwave conditions (480 W and 20 min), pretreatment yielded a total organic carbon release of 1.16 g/L, soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) of 2.3 g/L, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) solubilization of 28.8 %, respectively. The surfactant dosage of 2.1 mg/g TS concentration enhanced the microwave pretreatment and increased COD solubilization to 35.08 %. The synergistic effect of surfactant causes a notable increase in the release of soluble biopolymer. In addition, surfactant reduces microwave energy consumption by 25 %. Biomethane potential assay demonstrated that the surfactant-coupled microwave pretreatment produced more methane (0.105 L/g COD) than others. These results highlight the potential of surfactant-assisted microwave pretreatment in enhancing sago waste valorization for sustainable biofuel generation.","Rinsha, PV; Kavitha, S; Ravi, YK; Kathiresan, S; Banu, JR",Sago waste; Microwave Pretreatment; Surfactant; Anaerobic digestion; Biomethane,2025,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2024.133433,Physical,thermal,microwave,lignocellulose,sago,processing waste,,,,,,,,

Low-temperature thermal hydrolysis for enhancing sludge anaerobic digestion and antibiotic resistance management: Significance of digester solids retention time,"Recently, there has been a growing inclination towards utilizing primary sludge (PS) fermentation prior to anaerobic digestion (AD) in water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs), where sludge liquor containing volatile fatty acids is used for biological nutrient removal. Nevertheless, using a low-temperature thermal hydrolysis process (THP) to improve AD in WRRFs adopting PS fermentation remains an area that has received limited research attention. Here, we studied the impact of THP (90 degree celsius, 90 min) on anaerobic co-digestion of thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS) and fermented primary sludge (FPS) under varying solids retention times (SRTs) in semi-continuous mode. The study involved two THP schemes: scheme 1, where THP was done for both TWAS and FPS, and scheme 2, where THP was applied to TWAS only. The results demonstrated that reducing SRT from 20 to 15 and 10 d leads to decreased methane yield in both schemes. However, THP significantly enhances methane production, showing improvements of up to 37.9 % (scheme 1) and 31.2 % (scheme 2) under a 15d SRT. Furthermore, while decreasing SRT increased the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), thermal hydrolysis could effectively reduce most ARGs, indicating its potential to mitigate antibiotic resistance in the AD process. Overall, these results provide useful perceptions regarding the potential adoption of lowtemperature THP in WRRFs with PS fermentation.","Azizi, SMM; Zakaria, BS; Dhar, BR",Anaerobic digestion; Sludge pretreatment; Fermentation; Biosolids; Antibiotic resistance,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170392,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,activated sludge,mixed sludge,,,,,,,,,
Pretreatment with rumen fluid improves methane production in the anaerobic digestion of corn straw,"In this study, corn straw (CS) was pretreated with abattoir waste -rumen fluid (RF) at 39 C-degrees for 24 h and used to generate methane via anaerobic digestion (AD). The results showed that hydrolysis of CS was accelerated by rumen microorganisms, and the pretreated mixture showed a high soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) content (7210 mg/L). The biogas yield and methane yield of pretreated CS (Pre -CS -D) were 332.1 +/- 5.7 mL/g VS and 214.3 +/- 13.4 mL/g VS, which were increased by 18.7% and 23.0% compared with the unpretreated CS (CSD), respectively. 16S rRNA high throughput results showed that the dominant flora in RF was quite different from traditional anaerobic sludge, and its high hydrolytic ability could be related to the high abundance of Clostridia (57.1%) and Bacteroidia (19.3%). In AD period, methanogenesis of CS and pretreated CS were mainly completed through hydrogenotrophic pathway by Methanobrevibacter, but RF pretreatment resulted in an enrichment of acetate -nutritive Methanosaeta. This study would provide insights into RF pretreatment of CS for enhanced biogas generation, which not only treats abattoir waste but also benefits the AD industry.","Xu, FL; Mu, L; Wang, YF; Peng, H; Tao, JY; Chen, GY",Anaerobic digestion; Rumen fluid; Pretreatment; Corn straw; Methane,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2023.130831,Biological,biological active substrate,rumen,lignocellulose,corn,straw,,,,,,,,
A biorefinery model for the production of oil and biomethane using castor plants,"Castor (Ricinus communis L.) is an important oilseed crop worldwide whose inedible oil is widely used in the industrial, pharmaceutical, and agricultural sectors. Castor plants show high conversion potential for use as biorefining feedstocks. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of two nitrogen fertilization levels (0 and 120 kg N ha(-1)) on seed and oil yield. From a biorefinery perspective, the residual biomass of seed processing was analyzed in terms of fiber composition and biomethane production carrying out a biological pretreatment using two white-rot fungi (Pleurotus ostreatus and Irpex lacteus). Nitrogen fertilization resulted in an increase in seed and oil yields and a difference in capsule husk composition.

Anaerobic Digestion of Microalga Chlorella protothecoides and Metagenomic Analysis of Reddish-Colored Digestate,"Microalga Chlorella protothecoides materials were assessed as substrates for anaerobic digestion (AD) aiming at the simultaneous production of biogas/methane and pigments: whole autotrophic (AA) and heterotrophic algae (H); extracted heterotrophic microalgae from lipid production (HExt); and pretreated heterotrophic microalgae through enzymatic (HPEnz), autoclave (HPA), and ultrasound (HPU) processes. AA was more suitable for AD than H, as it was more efficiently converted into methane (279 vs. 180 L CH4/kg VSin). In comparison, the pretreatment of heterotrophic microalgae had a positive effect on AD, with registered methane yield increases from 263 to 290 L CH4/kg VSin (HPU, HPA, HExt). Reddish pigmentation developed in H and HPU units due to the presence of purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNSB). This phenomenon and the changes in microbiota structure during AD were confirmed by metagenomic analysis. At the end of the process, the relative abundance of Clostridiales and Bacillales increased, enhancing the hydrolysis of compounds in acetate. Consistently, Methanosaeta became the comparatively dominant methanogen, meaning that methane was produced through the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway.

Improving dry anaerobic methane production from OFMSW by co-digestion with grass waste and pretreatment with white rot fungi,"Anaerobic digestion is a process that can provide both clean energy and environmentally sustainable manage-ment of organic wastes. However, dry anaerobic digestion is susceptible to inhibitions and still has technological hurdles that limit its implementation. The study of operational parameters for the treatment of OFMSW in many places of the world is conducted, but the effect of the substrate composition is poorly understood. The present study evaluated strategies to enhance methane production from two different types of OFMSW, provided by two municipalities of Sabana Centro (Colombia), that are distinguished from each other by the presence (Cajic ' a, W1) and absence (Chia, W2) of meat residues. For both residues, higher methane production was achieved when the lowest substrate to inoculum ratio was used. ACoD with MGW enhanced biogas production with both sources of OFMSW, increasing 61% of production when non-meat residues were used, and always being necessary for production on residues with meat. Fungal pretreatment did not increase methane yields as expected from ex-periences in other studies due to pH drops and the accumulation of potential toxic inhibitors. In conclusion, as organic waste composition is critical to achieve an efficient dry anaerobic digestion performance, results pre-sented in this work highlights the need to consider how much nature of the substrate influences the process. The findings of this study hold significance for the scientific community working on dry anaerobic digestion. The study presents novel insights into the co-digestion of OFMSW and the pretreatment with the WRF. Furthermore, the results have practical implications for local authorities in Sabana Centro. Based on these findings, policy -makers can formulate new source-separation policies, and a dry anaerobic digestion facility can be designed to meet the specific characteristics of the substrates.","Franceschi, FF; Acosta-González, A; Vega, LT; Gomez, MF",Biogas; Co -digestion; Dry anaerobic digestion; Fungal pretreatment; OFMSW,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2023.04.015,Biological,fungi,white rot,ofmsw,ofmsw+green waste,,,,,,,,,
"Integrated aerobic-anaerobic digestion of highly solids-loaded corn stover and swine manure under dynamic aeration: Temperature rise, physicochemical characteristics, and methane production","This research aimed to design an integrated aerobic-anaerobic reactor with dynamic aeration that was automatically regulated based on real-time oxygen concentration and investigate the aerobic pretreatment and subsequent dry co-anaerobic digestion (co-AD) characteristics of highly solids-loaded corn stover and swine manure in terms of temperature rise, physiochemical characteristics, and methane production. The high- temperature feedstocks from the aerobic pretreatment phase rapidly entered the AD phase without transportation and effectively improved the start-up and methane production of the co-AD. Oxygen concentration range, aeration rate, and pretreatment time affected the cumulative aeration time, temperature rise, and organic matter removal interactively during aerobic pretreatment, and a low aeration rate was relatively preferable. Although the lignocellulose removal increased with the increase in pretreatment duration, the maximal lignin elimination efficiency only reached 1.30%. The inoculum injection in the transition phase from aerobic pretreatment to co-AD and the leachate reflux during co-AD were also critical for producing methane steadily apart from aerobic pretreatment. The cold air weakened the temperature rise of aerobic pretreatment, and the low- temperature leachate reduced the methane production in the co-AD process. An oxygen concentration range of 13%-17%, aeration rate of 0.10 m3/(min & sdot;m3), 3 /(min & sdot;m 3 ), pretreatment time of 84 h, inoculum loading of 40%, leachate refluxing thrice per day, and double-layer inoculation were optimum for improving the integrated aerobic- anaerobic digestion system's ability to resist low temperatures and achieving high methane production. The maximal cumulative and volatile solids (VS) methane yields of corn stover and swine manure reached 444.58 L and 266.30 L/kg VS.","Wang, LL; Wang, ZC; Wang, ZJ; Zheng, JK",Integrated aerobic-anaerobic digestion; Aerobic pretreatment; Dynamic aeration; Corn stover; Swine manure; Methane production,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121864,Biological,aerobic,,lignocellulose,corn,stover,,,,,,,,
Effect of Alkaline Pretreatment on the Characteristics of Barley Straw and Modeling of Methane Production via Codigestion of Pretreated Straw with Sewage Sludge,"Straw pretreatment enhances the cellulose accessibility and increases the methane yield from anaerobic digestion. This study investigated the effects of alkali pretreatments with different chemical agents (NaOH, KOH, and Na2CO3) on the physicochemical and thermal characteristics of barley straw, as well as methane production from codigestion with sewage sludge. Artificial neural network modeling with a feedforward neural network (FFNN) and slime mold optimization (SMO) techniques were used to predict methane production. NaOH pretreatment was shown to be the best pretreatment for removing hemicellulose and lignin and for increasing the cellulose accessibility. Moreover, there was a 2.57 -fold higher level of methane production compared to that from codigestion with untreated straw. The removal ratios for the total solids, volatile solids, and chemical oxygen demand reached 59.3, 67.2, and 73.4%, respectively. The modeling results showed that the FFNN-SMO method can be an effective tool for simulating the methane generation process, since training, validating, and testing produced very high correlation coefficients. The FFNN-SMO accurately predicted the amount of methane produced, with an R2 of 0.998 and a 3.1x10-5 root mean square error (RMSE).","Alrowais, R; Daiem, MMA; Helmi, AM; Nasef, BM; Hari, AR; Saikaly, P; Said, N",Alkali pretreatment; Barley straw; Anaerobic digestion; Artificial neural networks (ANNs); Slime mold optimizer (SMO),2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.15376/biores.19.2.2179-2200,Chemical,alkaline,,lignocellulose,barley,straw,,,,,,,,
Ultrasonic Disintegration to Improve Anaerobic Digestion of Microalgae with Hard Cell Walls-Scenedesmus sp. and Pinnularia sp.,"Microalgae are considered to be very promising feedstocks for biomethane production.

Impact of Chemical and Physical Pretreatment on Methane Potential of Peanut Shells,"The request for alternative sources of energy has led to evaluating untapped routes for energy production, such as using abundant and low-cost waste materials, e.g., lignocellulosic wastes, as the substrate for biological processes aimed at biofuel production. This study focused on peanut shells (PS) valorisation via anaerobic digestion (AD). Two emerging pretreatments, i.e., organosolv and ultrasounds, were investigated to unlock the full AD potential of PS. The impact of a substrate-to-solvent ratio in organosolv pretreatment was investigated (i.e., 1:5 vs. 1:10 vs. 1:20). Different exposure times were tested for ultrasound pretreatment, corresponding to applied energy densities of 30,000, 12,000, and 6000 kJ/kg VS, respectively. Organosolv pretreatment achieved the maximal polyphenol solubilisation, i.e., 4.90 mg/g TS, when increasing the substrate-to-solvent ratio, whereas methane production did not benefit from the pretreatment, being comparable with that of raw PS at most (i.e., 55.0 mL CH4/g VS). On the other hand, ultrasounds mainly affected sugar solubilisation (up to 37.90 mg/g TS), enhancing methane production up to an extra 64%, achieved with the highest energy density.

Innovative organic waste pretreatment approach for efficient anaerobic bioconversion: Effect of recirculation ratio at pre-processing in vortex layer apparatus on biogas production,"Agricultural waste, called biomass, is of great interest as a renewable energy source. The purpose of this work was to determine the optimal recirculation rate (RR) values of the solid digestate when applying a new approach to the intensification of anaerobic conversion, providing a high quality biogas yield. This approach includes solid digestate recirculation and pre-processing a mixture of raw waste and solid digestate in a vortex layer apparatus. For this, the operation of an experimental biogas plant without recirculation and with recirculation was considered, starting from very low RR values, from 0.034 to 1, to ensure a high methane production rate (MPR) and methane yield (MY). From the point of view of MPR and MY, the recirculation ratios of 0.034 and 0.071 look the most attractive, however, with a recirculation ratio of 0.5, the content of hydrogen sulfide de-creased to 14 ppm with a simultaneous increase in MPR by 12 % compared to the control.","Kovalev, AA; Kovalev, DA; Karaev, JV; Vivekanand, V; Pareek, N; Masakapalli, SK; Osmonov, OM; Zhuravleva, EA; Laikova, AA; Shekhurdina, SV; Litti, YV",Hydrogen; Biohydrogen; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Digestate recirculation; Solid digestate; Vortex layer apparatus; Pretreatment; Organic waste,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.044,Biological,biological active substrate,digestate recirculation,lignocellulose,agricultural waste,mixed,,,,,,,,
"Deep eutectic solvent pretreatment of cork dust - Effects on biomass composition, phenolic extraction and anaerobic degradability","In this study, phenolic compounds using deep eutectic solvents (DES) were extracted from cork dust, and the biogas production potential of DES-treated cork dust samples was determined. The DES treatment was carried out using choline chloride and formic acid (1:2 M ratio) at various temperatures (90, 110 and 130 degrees C) and treatment times (20, 40 and 60 min) at a solid-to-solvent ratio of 1:10 g mL(-1). The highest total phenolic content (137 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) g(-1) dry cork dust) was achieved at 110 degrees C/20 min. The extracts exhibited an antioxidant capacity of up to 56.3 +/- 3.1 % 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydazyl (DPPH) inhibition at a dilution rate of 100. DES treatment resulted in minimal sugar solubilization at low temperatures, while approximately 42 % of the xylan fraction in the biomass degraded under severe conditions (e.g., 130 degrees C/60 min). Catechin, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and gallic acid were the major phenolics in DES extracts. The biogas yield of DES-treated cork dust increased with treatment severity. The highest biogas yield (115.1 mL(N) g(VS)(-1)) was observed at 130 degrees C/60 min, representing an increase of 125 % compared to the untreated sample. SEM images revealed that the surface structure of the samples became smoother after mild pretreatment and rougher after harsh pretreatment. Compositional and FTIR analyses indicated that a higher biogas formation potential was associated with increased cellulose content in the substrate, which could be attributed to hemicellulose solubilization in the hydrolysate. Overall, DES pretreatment effectively enhanced phenol extraction and anaerobic degradability.","Elmaci, SB; Schultz, J; Isci, A; Scherzinger, M; Aslanhan, DD; Cam, MD; Sakiyan, O; Kaltschmitt, M",Cork dust; Deep eutectic solvent pretreatment; Extraction; Phenolics; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2024.04.007,Chemical,solvent,Deep eutectic solvent,wood,cork dust,,,,,,,,,
Effect of pretreatment with alkali on the anaerobic digestion characteristics of kitchen waste and analysis of microbial diversity,"Kitchen waste contains high contents of organic matter and moisture, and it is prone to biodegrade and decompose to give odors. If not collected and transported promptly or treated improperly, it is highly likely to pollute the environment and spread diseases. Because the lipid content in kitchen waste is high and a portion of organic matter is not subject to hydrolysis, the development of anaerobic digestion technology has been greatly limited. Kitchen waste was pretreated with NaOH, KOH, and Ca(OH)2 with different concentrations, and 50 days sequencing batch mesophilic anaerobic digestion experiments were conducted. This study sheds light on the pollution reduction and energy generation of kitchen waste. The results are as follows: (1) The lipid content of kitchen waste could be reduced, and the concentration of dissolved organic matter could be increased by pretreating with alkali. The degradation rate of kitchen waste lipid reached a maximum of 50.51%, if 3% NaOH was added, and the soluble chemical oxygen demand concentration was increased by 235.3%. (2) The cumulative methane (CH4) output and biogas production efficiency were improved in the anaerobic digestion process with kitchen waste pretreated with alkali. The maximum daily gas output of kitchen waste pretreated with NaOH and KOH took place on the 11th to 12th day, with the biogas production efficiency of 40.4 and 45.2 mLgVS-1. The cumulative CH4 output was increased from 370.2 mLgVS-1 (untreated) to 393.1 and 434.1 mLgVS-1, respectively. In addition, the concentration of CH4 in biogas was increased from 54.8% (untreated) to 59.1% and 61.7%, respectively. (3) The Chao1 and Ace values of bacteria were increased first and then decreased. On the 10th day, the diversity of bacteria reached the highest value, and on the 20th day, the diversity of archaea reached its maximum. Therefore, it was verified that the improvement in the hydrolysis acidification efficiency and degree was crucial for the rapid and complete anaerobic digestion reactions.","Zhen, XF; Li, SE; Jiao, RA; Wu, WB; Dong, T; Liu, J",kitchen waste; pretreatment with alkali; anaerobic digestion; microbial diversity,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/gps-2023-0072,Chemical,alkaline,,food waste,kitchen waste,,,,,,,,,
Oxidative chemical pretreatment by piranha solution for enhanced methane yield of wheat straw: mechanism and kinetic study,"The present research work aims to explore the potency of piranha solutions at the best-optimized concentrations, i.e., 40% and 30% to reduce the recalcitrant and heterogeneous structure of wheat straw, and the treated wheat straw was denoted as WS40 and WS30. The effect of pretreatment on wheat straw was determined by anaerobic digestion (AD) in a batch mode, followed by the analysis of soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs). After pretreatment, the surface fibers shattered and detached, showing a distorted surface of wheat straw. An increase in the crystallinity of wheat straw after pretreatment was also observed due to the removal of amorphous cellulose and lignin. Enhancement in methane yield was obtained on the 9th day, which was 103 & PLUSMN;6.92 and 99.33 & PLUSMN;0.57 mL/d for WS40 and WS30, respectively. Displaced water measurement revealed that the pretreatment of wheat straw minimized the hydrolysis period by 14 days. It also improved the methane yield by 2.65 (WS40) and 2.45 (WS30) fold in comparison with the control which yielded 35.66 mL/d methane on the 23rd day. The modified Gompertz model (MGM), logistic function model (LFM) and transference function model (TFM) adequately described the degradation process and explained the kinetic behavior of the cumulative methane yield. Among the three models, MGM was found to fit best for the methane yield of WS40 and WS30.","Kanaujia, N; Rawat, S; Singh, J",Anaerobic digestion; Wheat straw; Oxidative pretreatment; Piranha solution; Methane,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42768-023-00151-5,Chemical,oxidation,h2o2,lignocellulose,wheat,straw,,,,,,,,
Synergistic effects of low temperature and alkali on the anaerobic digestion of corn stover,"Combined with the climatic conditions in cold areas, the effect of the NaOH-pretreatment at low temperature on the methane yield of corn stover was studied by anaerobic digestion at batch mode. For the alkali/freezing pretreatment, the sample reached a maximum specific methane yield of 280.48 +/- 21.75 mL/g VS at the conditions of freezing time of 15 days and 2.0 % NaOH. Lower temperature-alkali pretreatment had an obvious effect on the structure of samples, with significant changes in the contents of elemental C, N, cellulose, and lignin, as well as an increase in crystallinity. In addition, a higher energy conversion efficiency (77.9 %) was obtained for the sample pretreated by alkaline/freezing. The results showed that the methane yield after pretreatment followed by alkali/freezing treatment > water/freezing treatment > freezing treatment. Therefore, alkali/freezing pretreatment is an effective method to improve the performance of the anaerobic digestion of corn stover. This study could provide a pathway for developing a low-temperature pretreatment by combining with the climate characteristics of cold areas.","Wang, YY; Zhen, F; Ren, HW; Zhao, QL; Luo, CH; Wu, ZC; Li, LH",Corn stover; Anaerobic digestion; Pretreatment; Kinetics; Energy conversion efficiency,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2024.131458,Chemical,alkaline,NaOH,lignocellulose,corn,stover,,,,,,,,
Unlocking the potential of sugarcane leaf waste for sustainable methane production: Insights from microbial pre-hydrolysis and reactor optimization,"Sugarcane leaf waste, a byproduct of the growing global sugar industry, challenges agricultural waste management. This study explores its potential for methane production via anaerobic digestion. A microbial pre-hydrolysis, using lignocellulose-degrading bacteria, enhanced soluble chemical oxygen demand at an optimal initial substrate concentration of 40 g-volatile solid/L. Comparative analysis with untreated and bioaugmented leaves revealed the pre-hydrolyzed leaves achieved the highest methane production rate (MPR) at 14.0 +/- 0.5 mL-CH4/L & sdot;d, surpassing others by 1.47 and 1.67 times. Two continuous stirred tank reactors were employed to assess the optimal hydraulic retention time (HRT). Results showed a stable methane production with an HRT of 25 days, yielding high MPRs: 88.70 +/- 0.63 mL-CH4/L & sdot;d from pre-hydrolyzed sugarcane leaves and 82.57 +/- 1.22 mL-CH4/L & sdot;d from microbial consortium-augmented leaves. A 25-day HRT fosters high microbial diversity with Bacteroidota, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, and Verrucomicrobiota dominance, indicating favorable conditions. Conversely, a 20-day HRT results in lower diversity due to unfavorable factors like low pH during organic overloading, leading to increased concentrations of volatile fatty acids and lactic acid, with Firmicutes as the predominant phylum. This study highlights sugarcane leaf waste's potential as a valuable resource for sustainable methane production.","Sitthikitpanya, N; Ponuansri, C; Jomnonkhaow, U; Wongfaed, N; Reungsang, A",Agricultural wastes; Anaerobic digestion; Lignocellulosic materials; Microbial consortium; Pretreatment,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e25787,Biological,microbial consortium,KKU-MC1,lignocellulose,sugarcane,leaves,,,,,,,,
Impact of the thermo-alkaline pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) blended plastics,"Poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) is a biodegradable plastic that is difficult to degrade under both mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic conditions. In this study, the impact of the thermo-alkaline pretreatment (48 h, 70 degrees C, 1 % w/v NaOH) on the anaerobic degradation (AD) of PBAT, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and PBAT/PLA blended plastics was investigated. Under mesophilic conditions, pretreatment only improved the methane yield of PBAT/PLA/starch plastic (100 days, 51 and 34 NmL/g VSadd for the treated and original plastics, respectively). Under thermophilic conditions, the pretreatment increased the methanogenic rate of PLA, PBAT and PBAT/PLA/starch plastic at the beginning stage (22 days, 35 and 79 NmL/g VSadd for original and treated PBAT, respectively), but did not change the methane yield at the end of the incubation (100 days, 91 NmL/g VSadd for original and treated PBAT). The reduction in the molecular weight and the formation of pore structures on the plastic surface accelerated the utilization of plastics by microorganisms. Furthermore, the pretreated plastics tend to form microplastics (MPs) with size predominantly below 500 mu m (>90 %). The numbers of MPs dynamically changed with the degradation time.

Impact of the thermo-alkaline pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) blended plastics,"Poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) is a biodegradable plastic that is difficult to degrade under both mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic conditions. In this study, the impact of the thermo-alkaline pretreatment (48 h, 70 degrees C, 1 % w/v NaOH) on the anaerobic degradation (AD) of PBAT, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and PBAT/PLA blended plastics was investigated. Under mesophilic conditions, pretreatment only improved the methane yield of PBAT/PLA/starch plastic (100 days, 51 and 34 NmL/g VSadd for the treated and original plastics, respectively). Under thermophilic conditions, the pretreatment increased the methanogenic rate of PLA, PBAT and PBAT/PLA/starch plastic at the beginning stage (22 days, 35 and 79 NmL/g VSadd for original and treated PBAT, respectively), but did not change the methane yield at the end of the incubation (100 days, 91 NmL/g VSadd for original and treated PBAT). The reduction in the molecular weight and the formation of pore structures on the plastic surface accelerated the utilization of plastics by microorganisms. Furthermore, the pretreated plastics tend to form microplastics (MPs) with size predominantly below 500 mu m (>90 %). The numbers of MPs dynamically changed with the degradation time. Several genera of bacteria showed specific degradation of biodegradable plastics under thermophilic conditions, including Desulfitibacter, Coprothermobacter, Tepidimicrobium, c_ D8A-2 and Thermacetogenium.

Alkaline-thermal and mild ultrasonic pretreatments for improving biomethane yields: Impact on structural properties of chestnut shells,"The high fiber content of chestnut shells (CS) makes biomethane production inefficient when using the anaerobic digestion (AD) method. Therefore, this study has evaluated for the first time the combined effect of alkaline-thermal (AT) and mild ultrasonic (US) pretreatments prior to the AD of CS. The cumulative biomethane yields (CMY) of untreated and pretreated (4% NaOH + 100 degrees C thermal + US) CS were 79.10 & PLUSMN; 7.9 and 266.9 & PLUSMN; 9.3 mL CH4/g VS, respectively. The effects of the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass at different intensities were interpreted according to amounts of lignocellulosic solubilization, soluble chemical oxygen demand/total chemical oxygen demand, and scanning electron microscope images. Solubilization of the lignin from CS with pretreatments varied between 44.5 and 65.6% w/w. The use of AT pretreatments, together with US pre-treatments, successfully increased the solubility of lignocellulosic compounds compared to the first case, whilst CMYs showed a positive correlation with lignocellulosic solubilization amounts. After pretreatments, total vol-atile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations were measured in the anaerobic process, from which the highest VFA was measured to be 1555 & PLUSMN; 108 mg HAc L-1, well below the appropriate value for AD (& LE;8000 mg HAc L-1). After pretreatments, the CMYs were successfully simulated by the modified Gompertz and Logistic model (R2 = 0.942-0.984).

"Enhancing cellulose acetate biodegradability in cigarette filters: an in-depth analysis of thermal alkaline pretreatment, microbial dynamics, and breakdown pathway prediction","BackgroundThe demand for bioplastics has increased exponentially as they have emerged as alternatives to petrochemical plastics. However, there is a substantial lack of knowledge regarding bioplastic degradation. This study developed a novel pretreatment method to improve the accessibility of a bioplastic substrate for biodegradation. In this study, cellulose acetate, a bioplastic found in the world's most littered waste, e.g. cigarette filters, was selected as a potential substrate. Before anaerobic digestion, three thermal alkaline pretreatments: TA 30 degrees C, TA 90 degrees C, and TA 121 degrees C, were used to evaluate their effects on the chemical alterations of cellulose acetate.ResultThe ester groups in cellulose acetate were significantly reduced by the TA 30 degrees C pretreatment, as seen by a decrease in C = O stretching vibrations and shortening of C - O stretches (1,270 similar to 1,210 cm- 1), indicating effective removal of acetyl groups. This pretreatment significantly enhanced cellulose acetate biodegradability to a maximum of 91%, surpassing the previously reported cellulose acetate degradation. Methane production increased to 695.0 +/- 4 mL/g of volatile solid after TA 30 degrees C pretreatment, indicating enhanced cellulose acetate accessibility to microorganisms, which resulted in superior biogas production compared to the control (306.0 +/- 10 mL/g of volatile solid). Diverse microbes in the anaerobic digestion system included hydrolytic (AB240379_g, Acetomicrobium, FN436103_g, etc.), fermentative, and volatile fatty acids degrading bacteria (JF417922_g, AB274492_g, Coprothermobacter, etc.), with Methanobacterium and Methanothermobacter being the sole hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the anaerobic digestion system. Additionally, an attempt to predict the pathway for the effective degradation of cellulose acetate from the microbial community in different pretreatment conditions.ConclusionsTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the maximum cellulose acetate degradation rate, with a simple and cost-effective pretreatment procedure. This approach holds promise for mitigating the environmental impact of cellulose acetate of cigarette filters and presents a sustainable and economically viable waste management strategy.","Prabhaharan, D; Park, H; Choi, O; Abraham, A; Sang, BI",Cellulose acetate; Anaerobic digestion; Biodegradability; Thermal alkaline pretreatment,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12934-024-02476-0,Chemical,alkaline,NaOH,lignocellulose,cellulose acetate,isolate,,,,,,,,
Modeling of the biomethane production from ultrasonic pretreated fruit and vegetable waste via anaerobic digestion,"The global dependency on the depleted fossil fuels has led to the quest for acquiring alternative energy sources. Different types of waste material are generated at a high rate and tapping into their use for greener, alternative energy production is an option. The mesophilic anaerobic co-digestion of fruit and vegetable waste and wastewater treatment plant sewage sludge experiments were conducted using ultrasonic pretreated substrates. Sonication exposure times from 0 to 45 min were selected for the experiments. An automatic methane potential test system (BMP) was used to determine the production rate of biomethane of the fruit and vegetables waste containing 60% fruit and 40% vegetables. The highest cumulative methane production of 238 mL g-1 VS was achieved at sonication time exposure of 45 min. It was observed that an increase in ultrasonic sonication exposure time, improved methane yield. The resulting experimental data was fitted with the modified Gompertz, co-digestion modified Gompertz, original Richards, modified Richards and co-digestion modified Richards models. IBM SPSS Statistics software was used for curve fitting and the estimation of the models' kinetic parameters. The modified Gompertz and Richards models showed higher goodness fit, both with R2 of 0.93 and modified Richards models did not produce a good fit for the data, with R2 of 0.7. The developed co-digestion models considered a combination of substrates that were easily digested as well as complex substrates that required multiple steps of digestion. The results show that the co-digestion modified Gompertz model had a goodness of fit of 0.98. Co-digestion modified Richard's model perfectly fit the experimental data, with R2 of 1. Both the co-digestion modified models are recommended due to their fitting performance. Fruit and vegetable waste comprise multiple substrates including simple sugars that digest readily and much more complex cellulose substrates that require more steps to digest and requiring the second step of digestion after undergoing hydrolysis. Both models took that into account. The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of the Gompertz and Richards model in the co-digestion of fruit and vegetables waste with sludge, as well as to develop co-digestion models for the substrates at hand.","Matobole, K; Seodigeng, T; Banza, M; Rutto, H",Anaerobic digestion; co-digestion; biogas; ultrasonic pretreatment; modeling; Gompertz; Richards,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2024.2431399,Physical,ultrasonic,,food waste,market waste,,,,,,,,,
"Analysis of energy return on investment of dry anaerobic digestion for low water alperujo with oxidative, thermal and alkaline pretreatments","Anaerobic digestion processes for biogas generation using alperujo have been the subject of intensive studies suggesting that phenolic compounds act as microbial inhibitors in anaerobic digestion. Pretreatments are needed to reduce the effects of phenolic compounds and improve biogas production, especially for dry anaerobic digestion. However, industrial-scale implementation of these pretreatments is challenging, and it is unclear whether the improvement in biogas production justifies the energy expended on pretreatment. This study examines the energy analysis of dry anaerobic digestion and three alternative pretreatments: alkaline, oxidative and thermal. Results indicate that thermal pretreatment at 80 degrees C with added water reduces phenolic compounds in alperujo by 35.4%. Meanwhile, pretreated with hydrogen peroxide in alkaline medium had the highest methane productivity (205 mL CH4/g(VS)).

Enhancing anaerobic digestion of dewatered sewage sludge through thermal hydrolysis pretreatment: Performance evaluation and microbial community analysis,"This study explored the effectiveness of thermal hydrolysis (TH) in conditioning dewatered sewage sludge (DSS) for enhanced anaerobic digestion (AD). The TH pretreatment employed in this study (30 min at 170 degrees C and 6 bar) significantly improved the bioavailability of DSS. The degree of solubilization varied with the physicochemical characteristics of DSS collected over three seasons: 16.8-24.8% on a volatile solids (VS) basis and 9.4-33.7% on a chemical oxygen demand (COD) basis. Correspondingly, the dissolved fraction of VS in DSS increased by 2.1-3.4-fold, and the soluble fraction of COD rose by 1.4-2.9-fold. The duplicate anaerobic reactors treating the TH-pretreated DSS did not achieve steady-state operation at the intended design organic loading rate (OLR) of 3.8 g VS/L center dot d, but showed stable performance at an OLR of 3.4 g VS/L center dot d with significantly higher methane yield (0.26-0.29 L/g VS fed) and VS removal (35-38%) than those reported for untreated DSS and comparable to TH-pretreated DSS. The reactors' microbial community structures changed dynamically as the OLR varied, with shifts in dominance between acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. The results highlight the prom-ising potential of TH-AD process for efficiently treating DSS while emphasizing the importance of optimizing OLR for stable operation.","Kim, H; Choi, G; Lee, C",Anaerobic digestion; Dewatered sewage sludge; Pretreatment; Thermal hydrolysis,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jwpe.2023.104617,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,activated sludge,mixed sludge,,,,,,,,,

Carbon reduction trade-off between pretreatment and anaerobic digestion: A field study of an industrial-scale biogas plant,"matWith the implementation of municipal solid waste source segregation, the enormous sorted biogenic waste has become an issue that needs to be seriously considered. Anaerobic digestion, which can produce biogas and extract floating oil for biodiesel production, is the most prevalent treatment in China for waste management and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction, in accordance with Sustainable Development Goal 13 of the United Nations. Herein, a large-scale biogas plant with a capacity of 1000 tonnes of biogenic waste (400 tonnes of restaurant biogenic waste and 600 tonnes of kitchen biogenic waste) per day was investigated onsite using material flow analysis, and the parts of the biogas plant were thoroughly analyzed, especially the pretreatment system for biogenic waste impurity removal and homogenization. The results indicated that the loss of the total biodegradable organic matter was 41.8% (w/w) of daily feedstock and the loss of biogas potential was 18.8% (v/v) of daily feedstock. Life cycle assessment revealed that the 100-year GHG emissions were -61.2 kgCO(2)-eq per tonne biogenic waste. According to the sensitivity analysis, pretreatment efficiency, including biodegradable organic matter recovery and floating oil extraction, considerably affected carbon reduction potential. However, when the pretreatment efficiency deteriorated, GHG benefits of waste source segregation and the subsequent biogenic waste anaerobic digestion would be reduced.","Shi, ZC; He, PJ; Guo, J; Zou, JL; Peng, W; Zhang, H; Lue, F",Biogenic waste; Life cycle assessment; Anaerobic digestion; Pretreatment; Material flow analysis,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2024.118139,Physical,mechanical desintegration,,ofmsw,municipal solid waste,,,,,,,,,
Impact of Thermal Pretreatment on the Physicochemical Characteristics and Biomethane Yield Potential of Solid Slaughter Waste from High-Throughput Red Meat Abattoirs Valorized as a Potential Feedstock for Biogas Production,"Rapid urbanization worldwide results in high demand for meat products, which in turn result in high numbers of animals being slaughtered for human consumption to meet food security demands, especially in low-income countries such as South Africa. The waste produced during slaughtering can serve as feedstock for biogas production. This study aims to determine the impacts of pasteurization and sterilization pre-treatments on high-throughput red meat abattoir solid slaughter waste's physicochemical properties and biomethane yield when used as a feedstock for biogas production. Abattoir solid slaughter waste was collected from 45 high-throughput red meat abattoirs across South Africa and the various physicochemical properties were determined using standard methods, along with the impact of sterilization and pasteurization on red meat abattoir waste. Biomethane yield analysis was performed using AMPTS II with a hydraulic retention time of 40 days. Pasteurization and sterilization pretreatment was seen to increase physicochemical parameters such as pH, volatile solids, total solids, carbon, and nitrogen analyzed in all samples. Pasteurization and sterilization were also seen to increase biomethane yield, where methane production ranged from 610.67 Nml to 1756.30 Nml, 1592.20 Nml to 3319.30 Nml, and 949.57 Nml to 3297.87 Nml for untreated, sterilized, and pasteurized samples, respectively. There was no significant difference (p < 0.05) observed in the effect pasteurized and sterilized samples had on physicochemical properties and biomethane yield. It can be concluded that pasteurization and sterilization enhance the bioavailability of the physicochemical properties and biomethane yield of red meat solid slaughter waste when valorized as feedstock for biogas production.","Matjuda, DS; Tekere, M; Thaela-Chimuka, MJ",abattoir waste; anaerobic digestion; pig; cattle; sheep; thermal pretreatment; biomethane; physicochemical properties; sterilization; pasteurization,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16052150,Physical,thermal,,animal byproduct,slaughter waste,,,,,,,,,
Enhancement in anaerobic biogas conversion by visible light photocatalytic Pre-treatment of rice husk with indium vanadate decorated titanium dioxide nanocomposite,Production of biogas from crop wastes via the biological route is one of the most demanding and promising technologies for energy generation for sustainable development. The incorporation of photocatalytic pretreat-ment as a robust catalytic technique has been reported to enhance the overall efficiency of the anaerobic process. Rice husk has been pretreated using Indium Vanadate decorated Titania nanocomposite to enhance its biode-gradability for biogas production. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the deformities and crevices that may support the role of the photocatalytic pretreatment in the subsequent anaerobic degradation process. FT-IR spectroscopy investigated the structural characteristics of pretreated and photolyzed rice husk samples. Gas chromatography was used to quantify the CH4 content of biogas yield after different treatments of rice husk. Photocatalytic pretreatment of rice husk showed 2.8 times higher cumulative biogas production than raw or untreated rice husk. Statistical analysis showed a significant difference between natural and pretreated rice husk biogas yield with a p-value of < 0.01. The results suggest that visible light active photocatalysis is an efficient pretreatment method that can facilitate the microbes to degrade the rigid rice husk for enhanced biogas pro-duction via the anaerobic digestion process.,"Rashid, J; Bhatti, TT; Hassan, M; Barakat, MA; Kumar, R; Xu, M",Anaerobic digestion; Biomass Pretreatment; InVO4; TiO2; Nanomaterials; Photocatalysis,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2023.128289,Chemical,oxidation,photocatalysis,lignocellulose,rice,husk,,,,,,,,
Utilizing Coagulation and Methane Potential Tests to Assess the Efficiency of Slaughterhouse Wastewater Hydrolysis,"The meat industry's significant freshwater demand and the consequent generation of substantial wastewater require effective treatment methods. With a global increase in meat production, water consumption and wastewater generation are on the rise. Simultaneously, regulatory measures such as the Fit for 55 package aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and preserve water resources. In response, the meat industry must explore sustainable practices, including reduction of water consumption and biomethane production through wastewater treatment. This study focuses on assessing the impact of hydrolysis on methane potential (MP) in slaughterhouse wastewater. To gauge hydrolysis efficiency, an in-house coagulation-based method was developed, proposing a new approach by comparing coagulation and filtration. Coagulation proves superior in presenting COD values closer to actual levels with less variation. Monitoring progress at 22 degrees C and 35 degrees C, with a consistent pH of 9, tests were conducted over 1, 2, 3, and 5 days. Methane production post-hydrolysis ranged from 178.8 to 242.6 CH4 Nml/gCOD across tested cases, aligning with existing literature. Optimal conditions for increased methane potential involved a 5-day hydrolysis at 35 degrees C, demonstrating a 30% average boost in specific wastewater methane production. This study provides a valuable exploration of hydrolysis effects on methane potential, offering insights for sustainable wastewater management in the meat industry.","Sztefek, A; Cema, G; Surmacz-Górska, J",Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Hydrolysis; Pretreatment; Methane potential; Slaughterhouse wastewater,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-024-07053-0,Process improvement,other,coagulation,animal byproduct,slaughter wastewater,,,,,,,,,
Effects of thermal pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion characteristics of fruit waste liquids,"Fruit waste is one of the main components of municipal waste. To study its potential and characteristics in anaerobic digestion, this study considered fruit waste and its waste liquid as raw materials, and investigated the influence of thermal pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion characteristics at a temperature of less than 35 +/- 1 degrees C. The anaerobic digestion materials were fruit waste liquid (group A1), fruit waste liquid after thermal pretreatment (group A2), and fruit slurry (group A3), and the materials of A2 and A3 mixed with the municipal sludge (groups A4 and A5, respectively) were also involved. The results showed that the thermal pretreatment increased the total gas production rate, where the waste liquid after the thermal pretreatment (A2) was the highest with 767.09 mL/gVS, which is 6.51% higher than A1, whereas it has no obvious influence on the total hydrogen production rate of waste liquid. Moreover, the addition of municipal sludge increased the total methane production rate of fruit waste and its liquid. After thermal pretreatment, the pH of fruit waste was 0.37 lower than the initial pH; the volatile fatty acids and soluble chemical oxygen demand content were both increased, which benefitted anaerobic digestion. In addition, the experimental data were verified by the modified Gompertz model. HIGHLIGHTS The thermal pretreatment increased the total gas production rate. Anaerobic digestion using fruit waste liquid decreased the anaerobic digestion period. Thermal pretreatment moderately reduced the pH of fermentation substances. The modified Gompertz model was used to fit the cumulative formation characteristics of biogas during anaerobic digestion.","Sun, HR; Wang, H; Zhang, XM; Cheng, WH; Li, XY",anaerobic digestion; fruit waste; hydrogen; methane; thermal pretreatment; waste liquid,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2024.388,Physical,thermal,,food waste,fruit,,,,,,,,,
Sodium disilicate pretreatment enhancing methane production from anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge,"Improving the efficiency of digestion is a major focus of waste activated sludge (WAS) anaerobic digestion (AD) research. This study investigates the viability and mechanism of sodium disilicate (SD) in enhancing the digestive efficacy of WAS. Batch AD experiments for the sludges pretreated by varied amounts of SD were carried out, and the results revealed that a dosage of 90 mmol/L resulted in the highest methane yield (247.9 mL/g & sdot;VS), marking a 90.0 % increase compared to the raw sludge. Mechanistic investigations highlighted that SD pretreatment facilitated EPS degradation, cell lysis, and modulation of interfacial interaction energy, ultimately enhancing sludge disintegration and methane generation. Microbial community analysis unveiled an enrichment of crucial functional microorganisms associated with hydrolysis, acidification, and methanation. The heightened presence of acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens significantly boosted methane production. Furthermore, metagenomic analysis corroborated that the SD pretreatment stimulated amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism (specifically ABC transporter proteins), and carbohydrate metabolism, thereby enhancing methanogenic activity through increased microbial metabolic activities and upregulated key enzyme expression. This research underscores the potential of SD-assisted pretreatment strategies in augmenting WAS digestion, introducing supplementary pretreatment avenues for optimizing anaerobic biotechnology.","Zhang, Y; Hu, SS; Li, JZ; Liu, M; Xu, LJ; Li, L; He, Q; Gu, L",Sodium disilicate; Waste activated sludge; Pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Metabolic pathways,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.154354,Process improvement,chelating,sodium disilicate,activated sludge,secondary sludge,,,,,,,,,

Enhancing methane yield and shifting microbial communities in anaerobic reactors treating lipid-rich dairy wastewater through exogenous lipase addition,"This study explores a novel enzymatic pretreatment approach in anaerobic reactors for dairy wastewater, using lipase AY Amano to enhance methane production and modify microbial and archaeal community composition. Batch and semi-batch reactors with a total volume of 2000 mL were used to treat dairy wastewater with initial COD of 2000 and 15,000 mg L-1, respectively. In a new novel approach, the semi-batch reactors underwent a three-phase operation: 30 days of acclimation, 30 days of rest, and 30 days of active operation. Adding lipase (0.05% wv-1) as a pretreatment significantly increased methane yield over the 90 days by 135-138% compared with the control (without enzyme addition). The organic loading rate reached 0.22 g COD day-1 L-1. Furthermore, 30 days after the end of the semi-batch reactor approach (120 days from the start), reusing sludge in batch reactors increased methane yield by 114-122% compared to the control. This increase was linked to the emergence and shift of new methanogenic communities within the sludge. Integrating hydrolytic enzymes into the anaerobic treatment enhances performance and sustainability by fostering methanogen-enriched microbial communities. This is crucial for maximizing methane production but may increase costs, requiring further economic feasibility research.","Abedalkarem, M; Dabbour, O; Asli, S",Enzymatic pretreatment; anaerobic digestion; dairy wastewater; methanogenic bacteria; microorganism's community shift; methane,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10826068.2024.2399042,Biological,enzyme,lipase,food waste,milk wastewater,,,,,,,,,
Steam explosion pretreatment of separated dairy cattle manure: Mass balances and effect on biomethane potential,"Manure is a renewable feedstock, whose theoretical potential for biogas production is scarcely deployed due to modest methane yields that prevent economic feasible operation of anaerobic digestion plants. Steam explosion pretreatment has the potential to improve the digestibility of manure, however it is energy intensive, and the optimal conditions depend on the feedstock. In this work, the solid and the liquid fraction of separated dairy cattle manure were pretreated between 130 and 210 degrees C for 5 to 40 min by steam explosion to individually determine the optimal conditions for each fraction. Additionally, mass balances for volatile solids (VS), cellulose, hemicellulose and proteins were performed to better understand the effects of the pretreatment. For the manure solids, a pretreatment at 130 degrees C for 20 min was most effective, the biomethane potential (BMP) improved by 40 %. In contrast, the BMP of the liquid fraction could not be improved at any pretreatment condition. The mass balances showed that at more severe conditions up to 18 % of the VS were lost by decomposition and/or evaporation, with the proteins being the most thermolabile fraction. Based on the observation, that a pretreatment of the liquid phase can be omitted, a heat integrated plant concept is suggested where the necessary heat input is only as large as in conventional anaerobic digestion. Taken together, this work underlined the benefits of steam explosion pretreatment of manure and identified the prevention of VS loss as a promising avenue for further improving the process.","Cazier, EA; Brethauer, S; Buehler, PC; Studer, MHP",Anaerobic digestion; Pretreatment; Biogas; Energy balance; Heat integration,2025,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2024.11.037,Physical,thermal,steam explosion,manure,cow,,,,,,,,,

Improved sludge anaerobic digestion capacity by dynamic membrane and alkaline-thermal pretreatment: Long-term continuous operation and techno-economic analysis,"This study explored the application of a dynamic membrane (DM) and alkaline-thermal pretreatment for sludge digestion with a low hydraulic retention time (HRT). The formed DM enabled stable sludge digestion at an HRT of less than 12 days, and the alkaline-thermal pretreatment at 60 celcius and pH 10 for 24 h further reduce the HRT to 6 days, resulting in an 82% increase in the average methane production rate. The pretreatment not only enhanced methane yield but also increased the abundance of methanogenic archaea and their specific methanogenic activity under all HRT conditions. Additionally, microbial analysis revealed that the performance of high-rate sludge digestion was associated with the prevalence of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla in the bacterial domain, indicating that the pretreatment promoted the growth of hydrolytic bacteria. Furthermore, the pretreatment process significantly increased the relative abundance of Methanosaeta at a low HRT, indicating an increase in acetoclastic methanogenesis. The permeability and resistance of the DM as well as the pump energy consumption were investigated with various combinations of filtration flux and relaxation ratio. The optimal values for filtration flux and relaxation ratio were determined as 8.2 L/m2/h and 0.33 h/h, respectively.

Effects of Short Retention Times and Ultrasound Pretreatment on Ammonium Concentration and Organic Matter Transformation in Anaerobic Digesters Treating Sewage Sludge,"Anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge is limited at the hydrolysis stage of the process. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of sludge retention times and ultrasound pretreatment on the ammonium concentration and organic matter transformation in anaerobic digesters treating sewage sludge. To achieve this, two laboratory-scale semicontinuous anaerobic digesters were operated for a period of over 70 d, including a control reactor and another fed by pretreated sludge. Both anaerobic systems were fed with mixed sludge (50%/50% primary/secondary treatment) in mesophilic conditions (37 degrees C), with solid retention times (SRT) of 7.5 d (Phase I) and 3 d (Phase II). The performance of the anaerobic digestion process was assessed in terms of the methane yield and the total and soluble chemical organic demand, total solids, and volatile solids removal. The results showed that the ultrasound pretreatment caused an increase of around 22.2% in CODt removal for an SRT of 7.5 d. Meanwhile, an SRT of 3 d resulted in a decrease of up to 92.4% in CODt removal. The performance in terms of biogas production and organic matter removal was significantly affected by the SRT reduction to 3 d, showing that the process is not viable in these conditions.","Olivera, M; Barriga, F; Neumann, P; Gómez, G; Vidal, G",ammonium; anaerobic digestion; pretreatment; retention time; sewage sludge; ultrasound,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation10010063,Physical,ultrasonic,,activated sludge,mixed sludge,,,,,,,,,
Comprehensive hydrothermal pretreatment of municipal sewage sludge: A systematic approach,"This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the potential impact of hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) on municipal thickened waste -activated sludge (TWAS) and its integration with anaerobic digestion (AD). The research demonstrates that HTP conditions (170 degrees C, 3 bars for 30 min) can increase the solubilization of macromolecular organic compounds by 41%, which enhances biodegradability in semicontinuous bioreactors. This treatment also results in a 50% reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and a 63% increase in the destruction of volatile solids (VS). The combination of HTP with AD significantly boosts methane yields by 51%, reaching 176 ml/g COD, and improves the digestate dewaterability, doubling the solid content in the dewatered cake. However, a higher polymer dose is required compared to conventional AD. Microbial community analysis correlates the observed performance and alterations; it indicates that HTP enhances resilience to stress conditions such as ammonia toxicity.

Enhanced Biogas Production from Thermophilic Anaerobic Digestion of Poultry Slaughterhouse Sludge: Effect of Thermal Pretreatment and Micronutrients Supplementation,"Poultry slaughter effluents contain biodegradable organics, which include blood, feathers, viscera, soft tissues removed during trimming and cutting, bones, and soil. Slaughterhouse sludge usually contains many of these compounds and a high concentration of pathogenic microorganisms. In this study, the influence of thermal pretreatment on the conversion of mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) to thermophilic anaerobic digestion (TAD) was evaluated, and micronutrient supplementation (Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo) to improve the production of biogas from poultry slaughter sludge. Six experimental stages were carried out, sludge sampling and characterization, application of thermal pretreatment, the adaptation of the mesophilic to thermophilic process, operation of TAD with increased organic loading rate (OLR), selection of micronutrient doses, and semicontinuous operation of TAD with micronutrients. The application of thermal pretreatment led to notable increases in the levels of carbohydrates, lipids, and soluble proteins, and a high inactivation of pathogens was obtained. The adaptation process from MAD to TAD required equidistant increments in temperature (+ Delta 5 degrees C) and operation time (Delta 15 days), resulting in a cumulative biogas production of 144.5 L. The TAD system effectively accommodated an OLR of 5 kgVS/(m3 d) without encountering inhibition. Moreover, the initial dose of micronutrients administered during the semicontinuous operation resulted in a 16% increase in biogas production compared to the control. Analysis of kinetic parameters using the modified Gompertz equation consistently yielded R2 values above 0.96 in all experimental stages.

Slaughterhouse sludge usually contains many of these compounds and a high concentration of pathogenic microorganisms. In this study, the influence of thermal pretreatment on the conversion of mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) to thermophilic anaerobic digestion (TAD) was evaluated, and micronutrient supplementation (Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo) to improve the production of biogas from poultry slaughter sludge. Six experimental stages were carried out, sludge sampling and characterization, application of thermal pretreatment, the adaptation of the mesophilic to thermophilic process, operation of TAD with increased organic loading rate (OLR), selection of micronutrient doses, and semicontinuous operation of TAD with micronutrients. The application of thermal pretreatment led to notable increases in the levels of carbohydrates, lipids, and soluble proteins, and a high inactivation of pathogens was obtained. The adaptation process from MAD to TAD required equidistant increments in temperature (+ Delta 5 degrees C) and operation time (Delta 15 days), resulting in a cumulative biogas production of 144.5 L. The TAD system effectively accommodated an OLR of 5 kgVS/(m3 d) without encountering inhibition. Moreover, the initial dose of micronutrients administered during the semicontinuous operation resulted in a 16% increase in biogas production compared to the control. Analysis of kinetic parameters using the modified Gompertz equation consistently yielded R2 values above 0.96 in all experimental stages. Overall, the findings highlight the positive impact of micronutrient supplementation and thermal pretreatment on biogas production within an enhanced TAD system.","Méndez-Contreras, JM; Atenodoro-Alonso, J; López-Escobar, LA; Nava-Valente, N",Biogas; Micronutrients; Sludge; Poultry slaughtering; Thermophilic anaerobic digestion; Thermal pretreatment,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-023-02277-3,Process improvement,nutrient,micronutrients,animal byproduct,poultry sludge,,,,,,,,,
Effects of hydrothermal pretreatment on methane potential of anaerobic digestion sludge cake of cattle manure containing sawdust as bedding materials,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of the hydrothermal pretreat- ment of anaerobic digestion sludge cake (ADSC) of cattle manure on the solubilization of organic matter and the methane yield to improve the anaerobic digestion efficiency of cattle manure collected from the sawdust pens of cattle.Methods: Anaerobic digestion sludge cake of cattle manure was thermally pretreated at 160 degrees C, 180 degrees C, 200 degrees C, and 220 degrees C by a hydrothermal pressure reactor, and the biochemical methane potential of ADSC hydrolysate was analyzed. Methane yield recovered by the hydrothermal pretreatment of ADCS was estimated based on mass balance.Results: The chemical oxygen demand solubilization degree (CODs) of the hydrothermal hydrolysate increased to 63.56%, 67.13%, 70.07%, and 66.14% at the hydrothermal reaction temperatures of 160 degrees C, 180 degrees C, 200 degrees C, and 220 degrees C, respectively. Considering the volatile solids content obtained after the hydrothermal pretreatment, the methane of 10.2 Nm3/ton-ADSC was recovered from ADSC of 1.0 ton, and methane yields of ADSC hydrolysate increased to 15.6, 18.0, 17.4, and 17.2 Nm3/ton-ADSC.Conclusion: Therefore, the optimal hydrothermal reaction temperature that yielded the maximum methane yield was 180 degrees C based on mass balance, and the methane yield from cattle manure containing sawdust was improved by the hydrothermal pretreatment of ADSC.","Lee, JH; Kim, CH; Yoon, YM",Anaerobic Digestion; Biochemical Methane Potential; Cattle Manure; Hydrothermal Pretreatment; Organic Matter Solubilization,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.5713/ab.22.0434,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,manure,cattle,,,,,,,,,
CO2 bubbling pretreatment to remove the inhibition of lime disinfection wastewater in a swine manure anaerobic digestion system,"Under the African swine fever epidemic, the extensive use of lime disinfectants has seriously inhibited anaerobic digestion (AD). In this study, the subject was swine manure containing lime disinfectant wastewater. The research set up a carbon dioxide (CO2) bubbling pretreatment device before it entered AD to explore the effect of breaking the inhibition of lime disinfectant. The results showed that the initial pulmonary hypertension (pH) of 11.0 and CO2 bubbling time of 8 h had the best effect, which could reduce calcium ion (Ca2+) by 73.0%, and the biogas production of the batch AD test increased by 28 times. In the continuous AD test, the Ca2+ of CK increased to 7.67 g/L, while the S1 pretreated by CO2 bubbling stabilized at 2.6 g/L, the biogas production in S1 was 112.4% higher than in CK. CO2 bubbling pretreatment reduces the concentration of Ca2+ in swine by utilizing the combination of exogenous CO2 and Ca2+, breaking the inhibitory effect on AD, and thereby improving the performance of the AD system. The test used CO2 in biogas to break the inhibition of lime disinfectants on AD, which was a convenient and feasible pretreatment process.","Li, SC; Wang, DH; He, LT; Wang, W",Pig farm manure; Lime based disinfectants; CO 2 bubbling pretreatment; Calcium ion concentration; Anaerobic digestion,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.140275,Process improvement,other,co2 bubbling,manure,pig,,,,,,,,,
Efficient short time pretreatment on lignocellulosic waste using an isolated fungus Trametes sp. W-4 for the enhancement of biogas production,"Biological pretreatment to the lignocellulosic waste prior to anaerobic digestion is a popular method to increase biogas production. However, the long time needed for the pretreatment is not suitable to the practical application. A fungus strain, which could produce many kinds of lignocellulosic enzymes including CMCase, FPase, xylanase and laccase, was isolated from the soil of Tibet in this study. The fungus was identified as Trametes sp. W-4 by morphological and mo-lecular characterization. The optimum culture temperature was 30 degrees C and the optimum nitrogen source was peptone. Under the optimum fermentation condition, the activity of CMCase, FPase, xylanase and laccase could reach 2.73 U/mL, 0.41 U/mL, 0.29 U/mL, and 1.11 U/mL, respec-tively. The results of pretreatment of Trametes sp. W-4 on the mixtures of high land barley straw, cow manure and pig manure for enhancement of biogas production showed that a very short time pretreatment of 3 days could obtain the highest cumulative methane production of 111.51 mL/g-VS, which was 63.81% higher than that of the control group of 68.07 mL/g-VS.

Synergic effect of thermo-chemical pretreatment of waste-activated sludge on bio-methane enhancement,"Sustainable and environmentally friendly energy production is feasible via anaerobic digestion (AD) of organic wastes, such as waste-activated sludge (WAS). However, due to its limited degradation, a pretreatment strategy is applied to WAS to enhance its bio-degradation and, thus, biogas yield. Alkaline (0.5%-9% g NaOH/gTS, 30 min), microwave (MW) (90 degrees C-175 degrees C), and hybrid (0.5% g NaOH/gTS +125 degrees C) pretreatments were applied to WAS. The characterization of untreated and pretreated WAS revealed that with higher alkaline and MW pretreatment, the soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD), carbohydrate, and protein increased; however, the readily biodegradable COD (rbCOD) rate was unlike the sCOD. The sCOD was 7%-18%, 8%-23%, and 37% for alkaline, MW, and hybrid pretreatments, respectively. Stronger alkaline and MW pretreatment induced higher turbidity, capillary suction time, and lower average particle size. AD of alkaline-, MW-, and hybrid-pretreated WAS produced 94% (0.5% NaOH), 125% (MW at 125 degrees C), and 199% (0.5% NaOH and MW at 125 degrees C) increased biogas, respectively, compared to the AD of untreated sludge. The AD data on the alkaline-, MW-, and hybrid-pretreated BMP assays fitted well with the modified Gompertz model with a coefficient of determination above 0.95. The PCA analysis showed that biogas production is closely correlated with pretreatment temperature, VFA production, rbCOD, sCOD, and soluble carbohydrates and protein. Microbial genome sequencing analysis showed an improvement in microbial abundance and diversity. Acetoclastic methanogen (Methanothrix) growth was improved by 37% (MW pretreatment).

Efficient environmentally friendly enzymatic and ultrasonic pretreatment of lignocellulosic wastes for enhanced methane production,"Pretreatment is compulsory to obtain the greatest possible biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass. Among the many different pretreatment methods, enzymatic and ultrasonic pretreatments are attracting attention as environmentally friendly methods. In this framework, this study aims to optimize enzymatic and ultrasonic pretreatment to achieve high methane production by anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic biomass consisting of agricultural residues. The optimization studies selected independent variables such as cellulase and beta-glycosidase doses for enzymatic pretreatment and ultrasound power, reaction time, and solid content for ultrasonic pretreatment. The optimum conditions for enzymatic pretreatment were determined as 32.68FPU/gTS cellulase and 14.56 IU/gTS beta-glucosidase concentrations to achieve a 60.15% increase in methane production. On the other hand, an 80.04% increase in methane production was obtained in the ultrasonic pretreatment under optimum conditions determined as 20 W ultrasound power, 60-min reaction time, and 5.46% solids content. The decrease in methane production by increasing the cellulose concentration in enzymatic pretreatment and by increasing the ultrasound power in ultrasonic pretreatment shows the importance of process optimization to achieve methane production. The theoretical energy productions were calculated and then compared with other pretreatment methods and the theoretical direct combustion energy. Since 90% energy recovery with ultrasonic pretreatment compared to direct combustion of lignocellulosic biomass was achieved, it is recommended to determine the effects of ultrasound in the pretreatment of other lignocellulosic biomass types.

Reduction of inhibitory effect of lignin via degradation and improvement of anaerobic digestion performance of maize straw by oxidative pretreatment with Fe2+-activated persulfate,"The stable aromatic structure of lignin is one of the factors that limit the utilization of maize straw. In this study, pretreatment with Fe2+/persulfate (PS) was used to remove lignin while reducing the contents of lignin derivatives produced in the pretreatment. In comparison with the original straw, the lignin and hemicellulose contents of the pretreated straw were reduced to 54.58 % and 72.91 %, respectively. In the Fourier transform infrared spectrum, the characteristic peaks of both syringyl and guaiacyl units were significantly weaker after pretreatment with Fe2+/PS, which indicated that the pretreatment destroyed the structure of lignin. The pretreatment products were examined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the results indicated that the present pretreatment method reduced the contents of soluble inhibitors produced from lignin. After pretreatment, only levulinic acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, xylose, coumaric acid, and 4coumaric acid were produce, whereas more than 20 soluble inhibitors are known to be produced from lignin. In anaerobic fermentation experiments, in comparison with the control group, the pretreated group exhibited higher gas production (an increase of 18.09 %) and a significantly higher methane content. This indicates that pretreatment with Fe2+/PS can improve the efficiency of the resource utilization of maize straw by degrading lignin.","Zhang, ZH; Rao, YF; Ye, MY; Zou, DX; Liu, RF; Liu, YP",Pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Lignin inhibition; Lignin degradation mechanism; Biogas,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2024.120795,Chemical,oxidation,persulfate,lignocellulose,corn,straw,,,,,,,,
Influence of Microwave-Assisted Chemical Thermohydrolysis of Lignocellulosic Waste Biomass on Anaerobic Digestion Efficiency,"To date, microwave radiation has been successfully used to support the chemical hydrolysis of organic substrates in the laboratory. There is a lack of studies on large-scale plants that would provide the basis for a reliable evaluation of this technology. The aim of the research was to determine the effectiveness of using microwave radiation to support the acidic and alkaline thermohydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass prior to anaerobic digestion on a semi-industrial scale. Regardless of the pretreatment options, similar concentrations of dissolved organic compounds were observed, ranging from 99.0 +/- 2.5 g/L to 115.0 +/- 3.0 in the case of COD and from 33.9 +/- 0.92 g/L to 38.2 +/- 1.41 g/L for TOC. However, these values were more than twice as high as the values for the substrate without pretreatment. The degree of solubilisation was similar and ranged between 20 and 28% for both monitored indicators. The highest anaerobic digestion effects, ranging from 99 to 102 LCH4/kgFM, were achieved using a combined process consisting of 20 min of microwave heating, 0.10-0.20 g HCl/gTS dose, and alkaline thermohydrolysis. For the control sample, the value was only 78 LCH4/kgFM; for the other variants, it was between 79 and 94 LCH4/kgFM.

"Application of Hydrodynamic Cavitation in the Disintegration of Aerobic Granular Sludge-Evaluation of Pretreatment Time on Biomass Properties, Anaerobic Digestion Efficiency and Energy Balance","The use of aerobic granular sludge is a promising and future-proof solution for wastewater treatment. The implementation of this technology requires the development of efficient and cost-effective methods for the management of excess sludge. The aim of the research was to evaluate the effects of hydrodynamic cavitation on the efficiency of aerobic granular sludge digestion. Respirometric measurements were performed at a temperature of 38 degrees C and an initial organic load of 5.0 gVS/L. The changes in the properties of the pretreated biomass, the kinetics of methane fermentation, the amount and composition of the biogas produced, and an energetic evaluation of the process were carried out. A significant influence of hydrodynamic cavitation on the transfer of organic compounds into the dissolved phase was demonstrated. The degree of solubilisation was 37% for COD and 42% and for TOC. The efficiency of CH4 production from the pretreated sludge reached a value of 496 +/- 12 mL/gVS, which corresponds to an increase of 19.6% compared to the raw biomass. The influence of cavitation on the CH4 content of the biogas was not observed. Strong correlations were found between the efficiency of anaerobic digestion and the concentration of dissolved organic compounds and the hydrodynamic cavitation time used. The gross energy yield was closely correlated with the amount of CH4. The highest comparable values of 3.12 Wh/gTS to 3.18 Wh/gTS were found in the variants in which the hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) time was between 15 min and 50 min. The highest net energy production of 2890 kWh/MgTS was achieved after 15 min of pretreatment.","Zielinski, M; Debowski, M; Kazimierowicz, J; Nowicka, A; Dudek, M",aerobic granular sludge; hydrodynamic cavitation; pretreatment; solubilisation degree; anaerobic digestion; methane,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en17020335,Physical,pressure,hydrodynamic caviation,activated sludge,aerobic granular sludge,,,,,,,,,
Biological pre-hydrolysis and thermal pretreatment applied for anaerobic digestion improvement: Kinetic study and statistical variable selection,"In the present study, two pretreatment methods (thermal pretreatment and biological pre-hydrolysis) were suggested for food waste (FW) with the aim to enhance biomass conversion and biogas production by anaerobic. The effects of thermal pretreatment (TP), including TP at 60 C and 80 C for 60 min, and TP at 100 C, 120 C and 140 C for 30 min, well as biological pre-hydrolysis (BPH) at 37 C, 55 C, 37 C followed by 55 C and 55 C followed by 37 C for 40 h on anaerobic digestion performance of FW were evaluated in batch tests. Results were compared with untreated FW. The BPH and TP caused an increase in the soluble chemical oxygen demand and hydrolysis efficiency. The methane yield (MY) increased from 371.17 mL CH4/g VS for untreated FW to 471.95 mL CH4/ g VS. The maximal MY was recorded for BPH at 37 C for 20 h followed by 55 C for 20 h. The pretreatments increased the biogas production rate and reduced the lag phase. The most influential variables on the methane yield were investigated using three statistical methods: Principal component analysis, Mutual Information and R-squared. The results allowed a good modeling of the methane yield and minimized the overfitting effect.

Microfibers in anaerobic digestion: Effect of ozone pretreatment,"Wastewater treatment plants receive significant microplastics, which are eventually discharged into the environment. Previous studies indicated that over 90% of microplastics, especially microfibers from laundry wastewater, are retained in primary sludge. The effect of microfibers from household laundry on anaerobic digestion has yet to be fully understood, which is the objective of the present study. The results in this study showed a positive correlation between methane production and the presence of microfibers. Compared to the control, the methane production increased by 2%, 27% and 43% with 20 mg/L, 100 mg/L and 1000 mg/L microfibers spiked into primary sludge, respectively. The present study suggests that microfibers at 20 mg/L insignificantly affected methane production in controlled anaerobic digestion. In contrast, ozone pretreatment of microfibers enhanced gas production by 12% in the same concentration level. Interestingly, ozone pretreatment at a higher concentration (100 mg/L-1000 mg/L) of microfibers did not affect methane production. SEM/EDX results imply that the ozone pretreatment has changed the surface characteristics of the microfibers, which provide more surface area for adsorption. The significant reduction of soluble phosphorus by 58% indicates that microfibers potentially act as a site for adsorption during anaerobic digestion. Overall, the presence of microfibers had a positive effect on anaerobic digestion. However, this work also indicated that the microfibers were not biodegraded during anaerobic digestion. Therefore, microfibers accumulate on biosolids, potentially affecting the final disposal of microfibers.","Li, J; Dagnew, M; Ray, MB",Microplastics; Microfibers; Anaerobic digestion; Ozone pretreatment; Methane production,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118792,Chemical,oxidizer,ozone,activated sludge,primary sludge,,,,,,,,,
Impact of hydrothermal pretreatment at different temperatures on biomethane yield in anaerobic digestion of rice husk,"The inadequate conversion of rice husk (RH) into biogas due to its recalcitrant lignocellulosic structure and high silica content necessitates the requirement of pretreatment prior to anaerobic digestion (AD) of RH. This study evaluated the impact of hydrothermal pretreatment on the solubilization of complex lignocellulosic matrix of RH and its subsequent influence on biogas and biomethane yield. The RH was pretreated at six different temperature levels between 200 and 250 degrees C, at an interval of 10 degrees C with 20% total solids (TS) loading and retention time of 10 min. The solubilization of RH at different pretreatment temperatures was evaluated by characterizing the liquid and solid fractions of the pretreated RH. The AD of untreated and pretreated RH revealed that the highest biogas and biomethane yields of 355 +/- 34 mL/g VSinput and 153 +/- 20 mL/g VSinput were observed for RH pretreated at 230 degrees C, 4.5 and 5.7 times higher than untreated RH. This increase in biogas and biomethane yield for RH230 was confirmed by observing enhanced volatile solid (VS) reduction (38.72%) and biodegradability (39.40%) compared to VS reduction (8.87%) and biodegradability (7.02%) for untreated RH. Further, correlation matrix analysis revealed a strong relation between pretreatment temperature and its severity on the fate of utilizing RH as an AD substrate and obtaining maximal biogas yield. Conclusively, pretreatment up to 230 degrees C could be recommended to enhance biogas and biomethane yield from RH effectively. Further investigation in pilot-scale reactors is recommended to validate these findings.","Kumar, S; D'Silva, TC; Chandra, R; Malik, A; Vijay, VK; Misra, A",Anaerobic digestion; Biomethane; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Rice husk,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13399-024-06106-y,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,lignocellulose,rice,husk,,,,,,,,
Comparative Study of High-Temperature Anaerobic Digestion of Municipal Sludge Under Acid/Alkali and Low-Temperature Hydrothermal Synergistic Pretreatment,"The efficiency of anaerobic digestion of sludge can be significantly improved through a combination of acid or alkali hydrolysis with low-temperature hydrothermal (LTH) pretreatment. The impact of various agents in conjunction with LTH treatment on sludge properties and high-temperature anaerobic digestion (HTAD) systems was comprehensively examined in this study. Comparative analyses reveal that NaOH-LTH pretreatment surpasses HCl-LTH pretreatment in enhancing sludge organic matter solubilization and enhancing HTAD system. Contrary to expectations, the use of acetic acid (HAc) pretreatment does not further enhance organic matter solubilization in sludge. Instead, it inhibits gas production efficiency and diminishes the removal efficiency of total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) during HTAD.

Impact thermal and calcium oxide pretreatment on the anaerobic digestion of food waste: performance and carbon emissions,"In this study, thermal and calcium oxide (CaO) pretreatment were used as a strategy to improve the performance of the anaerobic digestion of food waste. Meanwhile, the carbon emissions among the two strategies were evaluated. The results showed that both the two strategies could effectively promote the solubilization of organic matter in food waste and improve the hydrolysis rate of anaerobic digestion, which resulted in an increase of the methane yield. The highest methane yield (284.4 mL/g VS) was obtained in the group pretreated with 1.0 g/L CaO, which was increased by 23.8% compared with the control group. After the pretreatment, the anaerobic digestion pathway changed from acetotrophic methanogenesis to the co-dominated methanogenesis process by hydrogentrophic and acetotrophic. Meanwhile, CaO pretreatment had a better performance on the carbon emission which was increased by 23.75% compared with the control group.","Liu, Y; Tian, L; Qiu, W; Sun, W; Pan, C; Fan, G; Cheng, Q",Food waste; Anaerobic digestion; Pretreatment; Carbon emission,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-024-05863-7,Physical,thermal,,food waste,canteen,,,,,,,,,

"Effects of calcium peroxide pretreatment on the substrate, microenvironment, and microbial community in an anaerobic digestion system of waste sludge","In this study, the waste activated sludge (WAS) of wastewater treatment plants was pretreated with calcium peroxide (CP) for 48 h and then digested anaerobically at 35 +/- 1 C. The effects of CP pretreatment on the substrate, microenvironment, and microbial community in the anaerobic digestion (AD) system of WAS were investigated. Results showed that the total volatile fatty acids in the pretreated sludge increased by 8.95 times compared with that in the control. Evidently, pH and oxidation reduction potential (ORP) increased when the CP-pretreated sludge was further subjected to AD, where NO3- -N and H2O2 reached 29.65 mg/L and 11.8 mg/L, respectively, but the catalase (CAT) activity was inhibited. Additionally, CP-pretreatment activated the nitrifying bacterial phylum, inhibited the denitrifying genera, and selected the specific methanogens. However, CH4 production was still enhanced by 19.10 % unexpectedly although higher ORP was maintained in the AD system for a long time, which challenged the classical theory of AD. The acceptable feedback of the sludge AD system on CP pretreatment may be related to the change in H2O2 and CAT activities.","Wang, Y; Yin, JN; Li, X; Liu, YQ",Calcium peroxide pretreatment; Sludge anaerobic digestion; Nitrate accumulation; Hydrogen peroxide; Methanogenic bacteria select,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jwpe.2024.104985,Chemical,oxidizer,peroxide,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Enhancement of biogas production rate from bioplastics by alkaline pretreatment,"The effect of alkali-based pretreatment on the methanization of bioplastics was investigated. The tested bio-plastics included PHB [poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)], PHBH [poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate)], PHBV [poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate], PLA (polylactic acid), and a PLA/PCL [poly(capro-lactone)] 80/20 blend. Prior to methanization tests, the powdered polymers (500-1000 mu m) at a concentration of 50 g/L were subjected to alkaline pretreatment using NaOH 1 M for PLA and PLA/PCL, and NaOH 2 M for PHB-based materials. Following 7 days of pretreatment, the amount of solubilized carbon for PLA and its blend accounted for 92-98% of the total initial carbon, while lower carbon recoveries were recorded for most PHB-based materials (80-93%), as revealed by dissolved total organic carbon analysis. The pretreated bioplastics were then tested for biogas production by means of mesophilic biochemical methane potential tests. Compared to unpretreated PHBs, methanization rates of pretreated PHBs were accelerated by a factor of 2.7 to 9.1 with comparable (430 NmL CH4/g material feed) or slightly lower (15% in the case of PHBH) methane yields, despite featuring a 1.4-2.3 times longer lag phases. Both materials, PLA and the PLA/PCL blend, were only extensively digested when pretreated, yielding about 360-380 NmL CH4 per gram of material fed. Unpretreated PLA-based materials showed nearly zero methanization under the timeframe and experimental conditions tested. Overall, the results suggested that alkaline pretreatment can help to enhance the methanization kinetics of bioplastics.","García-Depraect, O; Lebreroa, R; Martínez-Mendoza, LJ; Rodriguez-Vega, S; Börner, RA; Börner, T; Muñoz, R",Alkali pretreatment; Anaerobic Digestion; Biochemical Methane Potential; Biodegradable bioplastics; Organic Recycling; Waste Management,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2023.04.009,Chemical,alkaline,NaOH,other,bioplastic,,,,,,,,,
Photocatalytic pretreatment of dairy wastewater and benefits of the photocatalyst as an enhancer of anaerobic digestion,"High-fat wastes are difficult to degrade and mineralize under biological methods.

Impact of sequential hybrid pretreatment in anaerobic digestion of food waste and garden waste co-digestion on waste characteristics and biogas production,"One-third of food produced results as food waste, with no organized and sustainable disposal, and ends up in landfills.

Enhancement of biomethane production and decomposition of physicochemical structure of corn straw by combined freezing-thawing and potassium hydroxide pretreatment,"Pretreatment is necessary for improving biodegradability and biomethane production from lignocellulosic materials such as corn straw (CS). In this study, freezing-thawing (FT) method was combined with KOH alkaline pretreatment technology to form a new CS pretreatment that was proposed to enhance anaerobic digestion (AD) performance. The results showed that among all pretreatment conditions, the -20 degrees C + 20 degrees C + KOH pretreatment group showed the best results, in which the biomethane production represented by the unit volatile solids (VS) was 274 mL.g(-1)VS(-1) and the removal rate of VS was 58.5%, which were respectively 39.8% and 33.9% higher than that of untreated CS. Additionally, the reaction mechanism of this combined pretreatment was revealed by the internal structure and chemical bond changes of straw. The ultrastructure and crystal structure of the combined pretreatment showed greater destruction, and the chemical bonds were obviously damaged. This is due to the dissolution of the frozen crystalline structures inside the CS before and after FT. As the dissolution proceeds, the alkaline pretreatment reagent acts synergically on CS, resulting in the increase of methane production.

Optimisation of Ultrasound Pretreatment of Microalgal Biomass for Effective Biogas Production through Anaerobic Digestion Process,"The anaerobic digestion, AD, process presents a solution for sustainable waste management, greenhouse gas mitigation and energy production for growing population needs and requirements.

Algae is a promising feedstock that could be used for energy production via the anaerobic digestion process. Microalgal biomass is rich in carbohydrates and lipids; however, many species of algae exhibit tough cell walls that could also be difficult to digest and may influence or inhibit the efficiency of the AD process. This study concentrated on the comparison of AD remediation of two marine algal biomass species, Tetraselmis suecica and Nannochloropsis oceanica. The two species were pre-treated with an ultrasound technique and compared for their methane production using biochemical methane potential tests. For Tetraselmis, a specific methane production of 0.165 LCH4/KgVS was observed; however, for Nannochloropsis, a value of 0.101 LCH4/KgVS was observed for the samples treated with ultrasound. The BMP results from this study show that among the two micro-algae species tested, Tetraselmis suecica is found to be a better substrate for methane production potential. Contrary to increasing the specific methane production, ultrasound cavitation caused a slight decrease in the specific methane production values for both Nannochloropsis oceanica and Tetraselmis suecica biomass residues.

"Effect of alkali pretreatment time on kitchen waste anaerobic digestion performance enhanced by alkali pretreatment combined with bentonite: performance enhancement, microbial community structure, and functional gene analysis","Kitchen waste was mainly composed of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Anaerobic digestion (AD) of kitchen waste usually occurred acidification and further deteriorated. In our previous study, alkali pretreatment combined with bentonite (AP/Be) treatment was proved to enhance high solid AD of kitchen waste. However, effects of AP time on AP/Be were not yet studied. This study investigated the effects of AP time on AP/Be treatment on enhancing high solid AD. The results showed that compared with the control group, the cumulative methane production rate could be increased by 3.30 times (149.7 mL CH4/g VS) and the volatile solids (VS) reduction rate increased by 63.36%. Microbial community analysis showed that the relative abundance of Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta were increased from 6.49 and 7.83% to 47.14 and 16.39% respectively. Predictive functional analysis showed that AP/Be treatment increased the abundance of energy production and conversion, coenzyme transport, and metabolism. This study revealed the potential mechanism of AP/Be enhanced kitchen waste AD performance and AP/Be was a potential strategy to strengthen AD.","Hu, FP; Fu, NX; Wei, Q; Liu, SS; Hu, YY; Zhang, SH; Wang, X; Peng, XM; Dai, HL; Wei, Y",Kitchen waste; Anaerobic digestion; Alkali pretreatment; Bentonite; Microorganism; Functional gene analysis,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-31646-7,Chemical,alkaline,CaO,food waste,kitchen waste,,,,,,,,,
Thermal Hydrolysis Pretreatment Effects on Endocrine Disrupting Compounds and Microbial Communities in Wastewater Sludge from Anaerobic Digestion,"Concerns regarding endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in wastewater treatment plant effluents have led to the need to better understand their fate during various treatment processes. The thermal hydrolysis process (THP) is a growing technology; this article aims to better understand the impacts of THP on EDCs. Serum bottles were used to understand how the THP of anaerobically digested wastewater influences concentrations of phthalic acid esters (PAEs) and antimicrobials. The succession of DNA-based microbial community was followed to assess conditions of contaminant biotransformation. Sludge samples were collected at different locations, placed in 250 mL serum bottles, and inoculated with samples collected from the anaerobic digestion solid recycle line to compare the influence of the THP pretreatment. Bottles were covered, kept at 37 degrees C, and agitated for 22 days, with periodic destructive sampling for the chemical analysis of antimicrobials, PAEs, and transformation products, as well as the microbial community structure. Results demonstrated an increase in the concentrations of triclosan (TCS), triclocarban (TCC), and their transformation products with and without THP pretreatment. 2,4-Dichlorophenol increased at a significantly higher rate in pretreated sludge, while the TCC concentrations increased significantly faster in untreated sludge. Pretreatment did not significantly influence the formation rates of TCS and methyl triclosan. Pretreatment impacts on phthalate concentrations varied. Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate decreased and diisononyl phthalate concentrations were unchanged. Benzyl butyl phthalate increased in sludge that had undergone pretreatment and decreased in sludge without. PAE metabolites generally increased during the course of the experiments. Results demonstrate the potential for complex transformation processes and indicate the ability of THP to influence concentrations of certain compounds of concern. Analysis of the microbial community structure did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference between sludge with pretreatment and sludge without over the course of the experiment. These results indicate that changes in chemical concentrations could be due to other physicochemical mechanisms not examined.","Armstrong, DL; Fischer, SJ; Lupitskyy, R; Kjellerup, BV; Rice, CP; Ramirez, M; Torrents, A",anaerobic digestion; endocrine disrupting compounds; microbial community analysis; thermal hydrolysis pretreatment,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ees.2023.0006,Physical,thermal,,activated sludge,mixed sludge,,,,,,,,,
Optimizing alkali-pretreatment dosage for waste-activated sludge disintegration and enhanced biogas production yield,"The rapid transition towards modernization and industrialization led to an increase in urban population, resulting in paramount challenge to municipal sewage sludge management. Anaerobic digestion (AD) serves as a promising venue for energy recovery from waste-activated sludge (WAS). Addressing the challenge of breaking down floc structures and microbial cells is crucial for releasing extracellular polymeric substances and cytoplasmic macromolecules to facilitate hydrolysis and fermentation process. The present study aims to introduce a combined process of alkaline/acid pre-treatments and AD to enhance sludge digestion and biogas production. The study investigates the influence of alkali pretreatment at ambient temperature using four alkali reagents (NaOH, Ca(OH)2, Mg(OH)2, and KOH). The primary goal is to provide insights into the intricate interplay of alkali dosages (0.04-0.12 g/gTS) on key physic-chemical parameters crucial for optimizing the pre-treatment dosage. Under the optimized alkaline/acid pre-treatment condition, the TSS reduction of 18%-30% was achieved. An increase in sCOD concentration (24%-50%) signifies the enhanced hydrolysis and solubilization rate of organic substrate in WAS. Finally, the biomethane potential test (BMPT) was performed for pre-treated WAS samples. The maximum methane (CH4) yield was observed in combination A1 (244 mL/g) and D1 (253 mL/g), demonstrating the pivotal role of alkali optimization in enhancing AD efficiency.

Enhanced anaerobic digestion of prairie biomass through alkaline-based hydroxycinnamic acid extraction,"This study explores the hydroxycinnamic acid extraction from prairie biomass as a potential value-added pretreatment for enhancing the performance of anaerobic digestion. Pretreatment increased the biomethane potential of prairie biomass by 33 %; when the extraction residue was left on the biomass, the biomethane potential increased by 100 %. When the treated biomass was co-digested with manure, a 134 % and 25 % increase in methane productivity and methane content was obtained, respectively, relative to raw biomass co-digested with manure. Hydroxycinnamic acid extraction also improved anaerobic digestion performance under biochar supplementation and liquid digestate recirculation conditions. Lastly, the extraction process was optimized for hydroxycinnamic acid yield. It was found that increases in treatment temperature and time could further increase yield by 5 %. Collectively, the results show hydroxycinnamic acid extraction can be used as a highly effective pretreatment for improving the anaerobic digestion of prairie biomass.","Rahic, E; Hess, CJ; Brown, RC; Wen, ZY",Anaerobic digestion; Pretreatment; Hydroxycinnamic acid; Prairie biomass; Biorefinery,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biteb.2024.101896,Chemical,alkaline,,lignocellulose,prairie cutting,grass,,,,,,,,
Recovering biogas and nutrients via novel anaerobic co-digestion of pre-treated water hyacinth for the enhanced biogas production,"The present investigation explores the feasibility of generating biogas from water hyacinth (WH) through a pretreatment process. The WH samples were subjected to a high concentration of H2SO4 pretreatment to enhance biogas production. The H2SO4 pretreatment aids in breaking down the lignocellulosic materials found in the WH. Additionally, it helps modify the cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, which assists in the anaerobic digestion process. The samples underwent pretreatment with 5% v/v H2SO4 for 60 min. Biogas production was conducted for both untreated and pretreated samples. Furthermore, sewage sludge and cow dung were used as inoculants to promote fermentation in the absence of oxygen. The results of this study demonstrate that the pretreatment of water hyacinth with 5% v/v H2SO4 for 60 min considerably enhances biogas production through the anaerobic co-digestion process. The maximum biogas production was recorded by T. Control-1, with a production rate of 155 mL on the 15th day compared to all other controls. All the pretreated samples showed the highest biogas production on the 15th day, which is comparatively five days earlier than the untreated samples. In terms of CH4 production, the maximum yield was observed between the 25th and 27th days. These findings suggest that water hyacinth is a viable source of biogas production, and the pretreatment method significantly improves biogas yield. This study presents a practical and innovative approach to biogas production from water hyacinth and highlights the potential for further research in this area.","Daniel, F; Sekar, M; Gavurová, B; Govindasamy, C; Moorthy, RK; Boomadevi, P; Praveenkumar, TR",Anaerobic digestion; Biomass; Methane production; Lignocellulosic pretreatment; Biogas production,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2023.116216,Physical,thermal,autoclave,lignocellulose,water hyacinth,plant,,,,,,,,
"Peracetic acid pretreatment improves biogas production from anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge by promoting organic matter release, conversion and affecting microbial community","Peracetic acid (PAA) pretreatment is considered as a novel and effective chemical pretreatment method for sludge. However, there is little information available on potential mechanisms of how PAA pretreatment affects sludge anaerobic digestion (AD). To fill the knowledge gap, this study investigated the effects and potential mechanisms of PAA pretreatment on sludge AD systems from physicochemical and microbiological perspectives. Batch experiments resulted that biogas production was enhanced by PAA pretreatment and the highest cumulative biogas yield (297.94 mL/g VS (volatile solid)) was obtained with 2 mM/g VS of PAA pretreatment. Kinetic model analysis illustrated that the PAA pretreatment improved the biogas potential (P-t) of sludge AD, but prolonged the lag phase (lambda) of AD. Mechanistic studies revealed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) (HO center dot, O-2(-)center dot, O-1(2) and CH3C(O)OO center dot) were the major intermediate products of PAA decomposition. These ROS effectively promoted the decomposition and solubilization of sludge, and provided more biodegradable organic matter for the following AD reactions. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing showed that some functional microorganisms associated with hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis as well as methanogenesis, such as Hydrogenispora, Romboutsia, Longivirga, Methanosarcina and Methanosaet, were significantly enriched in reactors pretreated with PAA. Redundancy analysis and variation partitioning analysis indicated that functional microorganisms were significantly correlated with intermediate metabolites (soluble carbohydrate, soluble protein, soluble chemical oxygen demand and volatile fatty acids) and cumulative biogas production. This study provides a fresh understanding of the effects and mechanisms of PAA pretreatment on sludge AD, updates the insights into the response of functional microorganisms to PAA pretreatment, and the findings obtained might provide a fundamental basis for chemical pretreatment of sludge AD using oxidants.","Ren, WY; Zhang, YR; Liu, XP; Li, SH; Li, H; Zhai, YB",Peracetic acid pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas production; Reactive oxygen species; Intermediate metabolites; Functional microorganisms,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.119427,Chemical,oxidizer,peracetic acid,activated sludge,dewatered waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
"Enhancement of Anaerobic Digestion from Food Waste via Ultrafine Wet Milling Pretreatment: Simulation, Performance, and Mechanisms","Particle size reduction is a commonly used pretreatment technique to promote methane production from anaerobic digestion (AD) of food waste (FW). However, limited research has focused on the effect of micron-sized particles on AD of FW. This research presented an ultrafine wet milling (UFWM) pretreatment method to reduce the particle size of FW particles. After four hours of milling, D90 was reduced to 73 mu m and cumulative methane production boosted from 307.98 mL/g vs. to 406.75 mL/g vs. without ammonia inhibition. We evaluated the performance of the AD systems and explored their facilitation mechanisms. Kinetic analysis showed that the modified Gompertz model predicted experimental values most accurately. UFWM pretreatment increased the maximum methane production rate by 44.4% and reduced the lag time by 0.65 days. The mechanical stress and collisions of milling resulted in a scaly surface of the particles, which greatly increased the voids and surface area. A rise in the XPS peak area of the C-N and C=O bonds proved the promotion of the liberation of carbohydrates and fats. Further microbial community analysis revealed that the relative abundance of Bacteroidota and Methanosarcina were enriched by UFWM. Meanwhile, methane metabolism pathway analysis confirmed that module M00567, module M00357, and related enzymes were stimulated. This study provided a theoretical basis for UFWM pretreatment applications and improvements in AD of FW.","Li, ZS; Jiang, XP; Shi, WJ; Yang, DY; Zhao, YC; Zhou, T",anaerobic digestion; food waste; milling pretreatment; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; kinetic modeling; metagenomics,2024, ,Physical,mechanical desintegration,ultrafine milling,food waste,canteen,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that BM pretreatment increased microbial and enzyme accessibility to the CS and facilitated the hydrolytic acidification process of AD. The peak concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) (5325.69 mg/L) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) (14524 mg/L) were increased, resulting in more substrates available for methanogenic bacteria. The lag phase time was shortened (37.41-56.12 %) and the cumulative methane production was increased (45.63-104.11 %). Accelerated rate of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) release resulted in increased buffering capacity of the digestion system. Reduced the initial density of the digestive slurry (6.91-9.58 %) and altered the water distribution (maximum increase in free water content to 70.4 %), which facilitated the agitation of the AD process. Excessive BM times (>60 min) and TS (>8%) are not recommended. The BM60-6 presented the highest volatile solids (VS) removal (78.79 %), cellulose degradation (92.07 %) and biochemical methane potential (BMP) (309.69 mL/g VS). The BM pretreatment also improved the rheological characteristics of digestive slurry and reduced the stirring power consumption of the AD process. The BM60-6 showed the largest net energy benefit (28.2101 KJ/g VS) and net residual value (0.5000), and the high energy input of the pretreatment was balanced. This discovery breaks the conventional wisdom that mechanical pretreatment is meaningless because of higher power consumption.","Qu, YP; Lv, XY; Qin, N; Zhang, KJ; Ding, XJ; Luo, LN; Qu, JB; Sun, Y",Anaerobic digestion; Ball-milling pretreatment; Energy conversion; Physicochemical properties; Corn straw,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2024.131409,Physical,mechanical desintegration,milling ball,lignocellulose,corn,straw,,,,,,,,
Enhanced Methane Production from Pretreatment of Waste Activated Sludge by Economically Feasible Biocatalysts,"Crude hydrolytic extracellular enzymes (CHEEs) generated by a mixed culture of microorganisms during fermentation have a high potential as economically feasible biocatalysts for the hydrolysis of complex organic wastes. This study investigates the feasibility of CHEEs as substitutes for commercial enzymes based on a series of anaerobic batch tests for CH4 production fed by pretreated waste activated sludge (WAS). The results showed that cellulase presented the highest CH4 yield of 99.1 mL center dot CH4/g center dot COD of WAS among the samples pretreated with single commercial enzymes, with a yield 34% higher than that of the control sample. A higher diversity of commercial enzymes used in the pretreatment led to higher CH4 production from WAS. The sample pretreated with a mixture of four commercial enzymes (amylase + protease + cellulase + lipase, APCL) presented a CH4 yield of 216.0 mL center dot CH4/g center dot COD of WAS. The WAS prepared with CHEEs resulted in a CH4 yield of 211.9 mL center dot CH4/g center dot COD of WAS, which is comparable to the performance of the sample pretreated with APCL. The results of the batch tests using pretreated WAS for different APCL concentrations showed that the CH4 yield of WAS pretreated with CHEEs was comparable to the CH4 yield of 0.34 g center dot APCL/g center dot COD of WAS.","Kim, TH; Song, D; Lee, JS; Yun, YM",anaerobic digestion; crude hydrolytic extracellular enzyme; enzymatic pretreatment; waste activated sludge,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16010552,Biological,enzyme,,activated sludge,waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Impact of natural degradation of the invasive alga Rugulopteryx okamurae on anaerobic digestion: Heavy metal pollution and kinetic performance,"This study shows, for the first time, how the natural biodegradation of the Phaeophyceae Rugulopteryx okamurae (R.o.) affects its methane yield, by biochemical methane potential assays, and the methane production kinetics. Additionally, a mechanical (zeolite-assisted milling) and a thermal (120 degrees C, 45 min) pretreatments were assessed. The highest methane yield was obtained from the mechanically pretreated fresh ashore biomass (219 (15) NLCH4 kg(VS)(-1)), which presents the use of zeolite during milling as an economical alternative for heavy metal toxicity reduction. Moreover, no significant differences were observed between the other tests (with the exception of the lowest value obtained for the mechanically pretreated fresh R.o.). Low methane yields were linked to the heavy metal content. However, an increase of 28.5% and 20.0% in the k value was found for the untreated fresh R.o. biomass and fresh ashore biomass, respectively, when subjected to thermal pretreatment. Finally, an enhancement of 80.5% in the maximum methane production rate was obtained for the fresh ashore biomass milled with zeolite compared to the untreated fresh ashore biomass.","De la Lama-Calvente, D; Fernández-Rodríguez, MJ; García-Gómez, JC; Borja, R",Rugulopteryx okamurae; Invasive alien species; Ashore biomass; Heavy metal toxicity; Anaerobic digestion; Pretreatments,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115005,Physical,mechanical desintegration,milling,algae,Rugulopteryx,Okamurae,,,,,,,,
Carbon fixation via volatile fatty acids recovery from sewage sludge through electrochemical-pretreatment-based anaerobic digestion,"Capturing the carbon in volatile fatty acids (VFA) produced from the anaerobic digestion (AD) of sewage sludge has the potential to not only provide economic benefits but also reduce greenhouse gas production. This study demonstrates a chemical-free method to collect VFA from an AD instead of methane that involves electrochemical pretreatment (EPT) of sludge. Experimental results show that applying 15 V EPT for 45 min enhances acidogenesis and selectively inhibits methanogenesis, leading to a substantial VFA accumulation (2563.1 +/- 307.9 mg COD/L) and achieving 2.5 times more carbon fixation than via methane production. Interfacial thermodynamic analysis shows that EPT induces a decrease in both the repulsive electrostatic energy (from 152.9 kT to 12.2 kT) and the energy barrier (from 57.0 kT to 2.6 kT) in the sludge, leading to increased sludge aggregation and entrapment of microorganisms. Molecular docking sheds lights on how the methanogens interacts with the organic matter released from EPT (e.g., alanine-tRNA ligase), showing that these interactions potentially interfere with the proteins that are associated with the activities of the methanogens and the electron transfer pathways, thereby impeding methanogenesis. Integrating EPT into AD therefore facilitates the recovery of valuable VFA and the capture of carbon from freshwater sludge, providing notable economic and environmental benefits in sewage sludge treatment.","Tan, YK; Xiao, YH; Hao, TW",Volatile fatty acid; Electrochemical pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Sewage sludge; Interfacial thermodynamics; Molecular docking,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2024.121736,Physical,electrolysis,,activated sludge,dewatered waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Substituting microalgae with fecal sludge for biohythane production enhancement and cost saving through two-stage anaerobic digestion,"Finding a low-cost, simple technology for producing high-quality bioenergy (e.g., biohythane: bioH2 and bioCH4) from waste biomass is challenging. Production of cleaner energy, such as biohythane, than methane from microalgae (MA), is a suitable approach. However, having a low C-N ratio of microalgae limits scaling up the process. Therefore, this study took the opportunity to use fecal sludge (FS) as a co-substrate for C-N ratio optimization to improve biohythane production while reducing cost. The biomass hydrothermal pretreatment enhanced soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) from 390 mgL-1 to 1085 mgL-1, resulting volatile fatty acid (VFA) accumulation rate of 1853 mgL-1 at a mixing ratio of 50:50. The results of two-stage anaerobic digestion (TSAD) of 50-50 MA-FS showed a cumulative biohydrogen yield of 24.5 mLg- 1-VS (Volatile Solid) and biomethane yield of 281 mLg- 1-VS with a synergetic effect of 52.7%. The techno-economic analysis suggests a return on investment (ROI) of 4.8 for utilizing a 50-50 biomass ratio. In addition, the input cost could be reduced to 75.6 % if the ratio of MA and FS was adjusted to 25-75. Therefore, the TSAD of MA and FS is a promising option to enhance the biohythane yield and its high economic potential.","Khalekuzzaman, M; Jahan, N; Bin Kabir, S; Hasan, M; Fayshal, MA; Chowdhury, DR",Biohythane; Microalgae; Fecal sludge; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Two-stage anaerobic digestion,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.139352,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,codigestion,"fecal sludge,microalgae",,,,,,,,,
Co-production and enhancement of biogas and biohydrogen by optimizing NaOH-urera pretreatment conditions for kitchen waste,"Kitchen waste (KW) constitutes a major portion of municipal solid waste, posing an imminent environmental challenge. Given its high water and organic content, KW is suitable for Anaerobic Digestion (AD) prior to its disposal, as it reduces Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and simultaneously generates biogas. The unique contribution of this study is the investigation of NaOH-urea pretreatment as a method to enhance AD of KW and sludge, ultimately leading to more efficient and environmentally friendly waste disposal. NaOH-urea pretreatment is selected for its ability to improve hydrolysis, increase organic matter solubilization, and enhance nutrient balance, ultimately boosting biogas yield during AD. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used for optimizing pretreatment conditions. AD experiments were performed batch-wise. For optimization, pretreatment time, temperature, and NaOH-urea concentration were selected as independent variables. RSM results indicated that optimum NaOH-urea concentration, time, and temperature conditions were 30 g/L, 30 min, and -5 degrees C, respectively. At optimum conditions, cumulative biogas was 316 ml, whereas biohydrogen % (v/v) was 36.21 %. Furthermore, the Modified Gompertz Model (MGM) and Logistic Function Model (LFM) were used to observe the efficacy of NaOH-urea pre-treatment of KW., The reaction kinetics were also discussed. Akaike's Information Criterion was employed to determine which model best fits the obtained experimental data. It was found that MGM is better than LFM for this study. Through experimental investigations and numerical modeling, this research provides insights into optimizing biogas and biohydrogen production from KW.","Zaidi, AA; Khan, SZ; Almohamadi, H; Rehan, M; Qyyum, MA",Anaerobic digestion; Kinetic models; Biohydrogen; Biogas; Kitchen waste; NaOH-urea pretreatment,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psep.2024.05.140,Chemical,alkaline,NaOH,food waste,canteen,,,,,,,,,
Chemically and Physically Pretreated Straw in Moderate Conditions: Poor Correlation between Biogas Production and Commonly Used Biomass Characterization,"Straw is a substantial agricultural by-product for biogas production. Hydrolysis of straw is found to be a rate-limiting step during its anaerobic digestion and could be enhanced by pretreatment. In this paper, the effect of various combinations of particle size reduction, autoclaving, and low-level Fenton reaction was studied on straw for biogas production.

"Comparison of acid and alkaline pre-treatment on methane production from empty palm oil fruit bunches (OPEFB): Effect on characteristics, digester performance, and correlation of kinetic parameters","This paper focused on comparing the impact of two different chemical pretreatments on various characteristics of OPEFBs (i.e., physical, structural, and morphological properties), methane production, digestate characteristics, and kinetic modelling. The biochemical methane potential (BMP) test showed that alkaline-treated OPEFBs produced higher methane yields than acid-treated OPEFBs. Accordingly, the methane yields became far higher after NaOH pretreatment, showing 0.186-0.224 m3CH4/kg VSadded compared with 0.102 m3CH4/kg VSadded and 0.093-0.115 m3CH4/kg VSadded from untreated and acid-treated OPEFBs. The best treatment was alkaline pre-treatment of P2N3, which gave the highest methane yield increase (by 1.2-fold). The Scanning Electron Mi-croscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) results of acid-treated OPEFBs indicated disruption of cell wall and loss of some minerals. However, alkaline-treated OPEFBs have more pores due to silica and other chemicals releases (i.e., lignin, hemicellulose, etc.). The kinetic study showed that all models (i.e., modified Gompertz, logistic, and transference) were in good agreement with the experimental data. Both experimental data and models confirmed P2N3 (i.e., NaOH concentrations of 3.8%) as the best results, indicated by the highest lignin reduction and methane production.

Low-intensity magnetization pretreatment to enhance biomethane generation and the abundance of key microorganisms for anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge,"This work explores the impact of static magnetic field (SMF) intensity on biomethane production from anaerobic digestion (AD) of sewage sludge. Two different SMF intensities (20 mT and 1.5 T) were applied to magnetize the sludge destined to the AD process. The magnetic pretreatment at 20 mT was particularly effective, as it increased biomethane production by 12.7 % compared to the control test. On the contrary, exposing the sludge to 1.5 T adversely affected biomethane production, resulting in a 15.1 % decrease. The positive correlation observed between low-intensity SMF exposure and enhanced biomethane yield, in contrast to the inhibitory effect of high-intensity SMF, suggests the existence of an optimal intensity threshold within the lower range for maximizing methane production. The impact of magnetic pretreatment on the anaerobic microbial community was investigated through high-throughput sequencing analysis of magnetized sludge samples. This approach enabled the identification of specific shifts in microbial populations associated with SMF exposure, thereby elucidating the role of SMF in modulating key microbial communities for the AD process. The findings of this study provide insights into the potential mechanisms underlying these responses and underscore the potential of SMF application for improving the anaerobic valorization of sewage sludge.","Di Costanzo, N; Di Capua, F; Cesaro, A; Carraturo, F; Salamone, M; Mascolo, MC; Carpentieri, A; Esposito, G",Static magnetic field pretreatment; Sewage sludge; Anaerobic digestion; Biomethane,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2024.131534,Physical,magnetic,,activated sludge,sewage sludge,,,,,,,,,
Enhancing biogas production from cattle manure: A circular economy approach with solar thermal pretreatment and soil conditioning,"Biogas production from cattle manure, pivotal for sustainable waste and energy management, encounters challenges from its low digestibility linked to lignocellulosic structures. This study investigates biogas efficiency enhancement through anaerobic digestion coupled with solar thermal (ST) pretreatment and digestate application in Napier grass cultivation (STAD-G). ST pretreatment at 40-60 degrees C for 20 h markedly increases methane yield, validated by pilot-scale trials that exhibited a 3.9-fold surge in methane production, attributed to improved acidification. Untreated manure's structure, however, impedes acidification, slowing methanogenesis as shown by lower volatile fatty acid concentration in effluents. In addition, utilizing digestate as soil conditioner notably improves grass yield (19.3 +/- 0.8 ton dry/ha/year) and protein content, akin to urea fertilizer. Furthermore, the STAD-G system incurs higher upfront costs, it yields superior biogas efficiency and enhanced long-term financial returns. This integrated approach, by boosting economic and environmental sustainability, advocates for ST pretreatment as a key strategy in advancing sustainable agriculture and energy solutions.","Samadamaeng, N; Sawatdeenarunat, C; Charnnok, B",Solar thermal pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Soil conditioner; Cattle manure management; Circular economy,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.122086,Physical,thermal,,manure,cow,,,,,,,,,
The fate of antibiotic resistance genes during anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge with ultrasonic pretreatment,"This study investigated the effect of ultrasonic (US) pretreatment at three different contact times (30, 45, and 60 min) with a power of 240 W and frequency of 40 kHz on the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and enteric pathogens during anaerobic digestion (AD) of sludge. By using real time-qPCR, three MGEs (int1, int2, and tnpA) and seven ARGs (sul1, sul2, tetW, tetA, tetO, ermF, and aac(6')-lb) were quantified that have serious human health impacts and represent the most widely used antibiotics (tetracycline, sulfonamide, macrolide, and aminoglycoside). Results indicated that US pretreatment under different contact times improved the removal of ARGs and MGEs. Compared to 30 and 45 min of US pretreatment, 60 min of US pretreatment resulted in a higher reduction of ARGs with total ARG reduction of 41.70 +/- 1.13%. Furthermore, the relative abundance of ARGs and MGEs after US pretreatment was reduced more effectively in anaerobic reactors than in a control AD without US pretreatment. The total ARGs and MGEs removal efficiency of control AD was 44.07 +/- 0.72% and 63.69 +/- 1.43%, and if US pretreatment at different times were applied, the total ARGs and MGEs removal efficiency of the whole pretreatment AD process improved to 59.71 +/- 2.76-68.54 +/- 1.58% and 69.82 +/- 2.15-76.84 +/- 0.22%. The highest removal of total ARGs (68.54 +/- 1.58%) and MGEs (76.84 +/- 0.22%) was achieved after AD with US pretreatment at 45 min. However, US pretreatment and AD with US pretreatment were not effective in inactivation of enteric pathogens (total coliforms and E. coli), suggesting that posttreatment is needed prior to land application of sludge to reduce the level of enteric pathogens. There was no detection of the studied ARGs and MGEs in the enteric pathogens after US pretreatment in subsequent AD. According to this study, long contact times of US pretreatment can mitigate ARGs and MGEs in AD processes, offering valuable insight into improving environmental safety and sustainable waste management. Additionally, the study highlights the need to investigate posttreatment techniques for reducing enteric pathogens in AD effluent, a crucial consideration for agricultural use and environmental protection.","Mortezaei, Y; Williams, MR; Demirer, GN",Anaerobic digestion; Antibiotic resistance genes; Ultrasonic pretreatment; Enteric indicator bacteria; Sewage sludge,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-31558-6,Physical,ultrasonic,,activated sludge,primary sludge,,,,,,,,,
Impact of Hydrothermal Pretreatment Parameters on Mesophilic and Thermophilic Fermentation and Anaerobic Digestion of Municipal Sludge,"Four parameters affecting hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) of municipal sludge prior to anaerobic digestion and fermentation were investigated. Partial factorial design including several key HTP parameters at two distinct levels, including temperature (170 and 190 & DEG;C), retention time (RT) (10 and 30 min), pH (4 and 10), and solid content (SC) (4% and 16%), were studied. Further, the impact of HTP parameters on mesophilic and thermophilic fermentation was explored and compared. Results revealed a significant effect of all HTP parameters on COD solubilization, VFA, and methane yield. There were correlations between HTP parameters and process responses such as VFA yield and methane yield. HTP was found to increase COD solubilization and VFA production between 15 and 20% during thermophilic fermentation in relation to mesophilic treatment. All parameters, including SC, temperature, pH, and RT, were important contributing factors affecting methane production during anaerobic digestion. The highest methane production yield of 269 mL CH4/g TCOD added was observed at the highest SC (16%) and pH (10) and at the lower temperature (170 & DEG;C) and RT (10).

The Use of Hydrodynamic Cavitation to Improve the Anaerobic Digestion of Waste from Dairy Cattle Farming-From Laboratory Tests to Large-Scale Agricultural Biogas Plants,"There is a need to find methods to intensify the anaerobic digestion process. One possibility is the use of pretreatment techniques. Many laboratory tests confirm their effectiveness, but in most cases, there is no verification work carried out on industrial plants. A reliable and complete evaluation of new solutions can only be carried out in plants that reflect operating conditions at a higher readiness technological level. This has a direct impact on the scientific value and, above all, on the high application value of innovative technologies. The aim of our research carried out under laboratory conditions and on a large scale was to determine the technological and energy efficiency of the use of hydrodynamic cavitation in the pretreatment of a waste mixture from dairy farms. It has been shown that hydrodynamic cavitation significantly increases the concentration of organic compounds in the dissolved phase. In the most effective variants, the increase in the content of these indicators was over 90% for both COD and TOC. The degree of solubilisation achieved was 49 +/- 2.6% for COD and almost 52 +/- 4.4% for TOC. Under laboratory conditions, the highest effects of anaerobic digestion were achieved after 10 min of pretreatment. The amount of biogas was, on average, 367 +/- 18 mL/gCOD, and the amount of methane was 233 +/- 13 mL/gCOD. Further large-scale optimisation trials showed that after 8 min of hydrodynamic cavitation, the biogas yield was 327 +/- 8 L/kgCOD with a CH4 content of 62.9 +/- 1.9%. With this variant, the net energy yield was 66.4 +/- 2.6 kWh/day, a value that was 13.9% higher than the original variant with 10 min of disintegration and 3.1% higher than the variant without pretreatment.","Debowski, M; Kazimierowicz, J; Nowicka, A; Dudek, M; Zielinski, M",cattle manure; milking station; anaerobic digestion; pretreatment; hydrodynamic cavitation; biogas; methane; energy efficiency,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en17061409,Physical,pressure,hydrodynamic caviation,manure,cow,slurry,,,,,,,,
Optimization of Biomethane Yield of Xyris capensis Grass Using Oxidative Pretreatment,"Biogas production from lignocellulose feedstocks has become an acceptable energy source globally due to their availability and economy. Lignocellulose materials have a complex arrangement that hinders digestion during the process. Therefore, applying the pretreatment process to lower the recalcitrant properties is required to utilize the full potential of the feedstock. This study, therefore, examines the influence of the oxidative pretreatment on the microstructural arrangement and biomethane yield of Xyris capensis. Piranha solution was prepared using H2O2 and H2SO4 at 100, 95:5, 85:15, and 75:25% of H2O2:H2SO4, respectively, and Xyris capensis grass was soaked in the prepared solution. The pretreated and untreated feedstocks were examined under the scanning electron microscope (SEM) to study the effect of the pretreatment on the microstructural arrangement. The effect of the pretreatment on biomethane yield was investigated during anaerobic digestion in a laboratory-scale batch digester at a mesophilic temperature (37 ?). The SEM analysis shows that the oxidative pretreatment method significantly affects the substrate's microstructure, and the pretreatment's severity depends on the percentage of H2SO4 added. A biomethane yield of 174.41, 188.61, 192.23, 207.51, and 139.71 mL CH4/g VSadded was observed, and the yield was increased by between 24.84 and 48.52% compared to the untreated substrate. Therefore, applying oxidative pretreatment using low-cost H2O2 is a clear method of improving the biomethane yield of lignocellulose feedstocks.","Olatunji, KO; Madyira, DM",anaerobic digestion; lignocellulose material; Xyris capensis; oxidative pretreatment; microstructural arrangement; biomethane,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16103977,Chemical,oxidation,,lignocellulose,Xyris,grass,,,,,,,,
Phosphorus release and realignment in anaerobic digestion of thermal hydrolysis pretreatment sludge - Masking effects from high ammonium,"Waste activated sludge (WAS) is a significant phosphorus (P) repository, and there is a growing interest in P recovery from WAS. Typically, the commercial technology for treating WAS involves thermal hydrolysis pretreatment (THP) coupled with anaerobic digestion (AD). However, there is ongoing debate regarding the transformation and distribution of P throughout this process. To address this, a long-term THP-AD process was operated in this study to comprehensively investigate P transformation and distribution. The results revealed that a substantial biodegradation of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) raised the pH of the digestate to 8.3 during the AD process. This increased pH facilitated the dissolution of Al, leading to a reduction of 6.92 mg/L of NaOH-P. Simultaneously, sulfate reduction contributed to a decrease of 11.04 mg/L of Bipy-P in the solid. However, the reduction of Bipy-P and NaOH-P in the solid did not result in an improved P release to the supernatant. Conversely, a decrease of 23.60 mg/L P in the aqueous phase was observed after anaerobic digestion. The disappeared P was primarily precipitated with Mg and Ca, driven by the increased pH, and it contributed to the increase of HCl-P in the solid from 107.80 to 144.52 mg/L. These findings were further confirmed by results obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and solid-state 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of P transformation during THP-AD process that is nearly opposite from conventional AD system.","Chen, Y; Ding, W; Bai, Y; Wang, X; Shen, N; Li, L; Lu, D; Zhou, Y",Anaerobic digestion; Waste activated sludge; Thermal hydrolysis pretreatment; Phosphorus realignment; Dissolved organic nitrogen biodegradation,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2024.121488,Physical,thermal,,activated sludge,thickened waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,
Ammonia stripping by in situ biogas self-circulation to upgrade continuous thermophilic and mesophilic digestion of hydrothermal high-solid sludge,"High -solid anaerobic digestion of hydrothermal sewage sludge has been developed. In order to upgrade the process by focusing on ammonia inhibition, a simply -equipped stripping system without additional alkali or heat supply was introduced by in situ biogas self -circulation. As the determined limit of total ammonia nitrogen at 1500 mg/L and 1000 mg/L for the mesophilic (MAD) and thermophilic anaerobic digestion (TAD) respectively and stripping rate at 5 L/min, continuous MAD and TAD was conducted in parallel. The stripping system successfully polished up the ammonia inhibition, and methanogenic capability of the TAD was promoted to approximately 90.0 % of the potential. Intermittent stripping mode proved usable. More frequent stripping was inevitable for the TAD as compared to the MAD. Hydraulic retention time below 20 d resulted in failure of the stripping mode due to rapid ammonia generation. Overall, this technology was practical in upgrading high -solid sludge digestion by effective ammonia control.","Wu, LJ; Li, XX; Ye, F; Liu, YX; Yang, F; Zhou, Q; Lyu, YK",Ammonia inhibition; Continuous operation; High-solid anaerobic digestion; Hydrothermal pretreatment; Sewage sludge,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2024.130797,Process improvement,desinhibition,ammmonia stripping,activated sludge,sewage sludge,,,,,,,,,
Agronomic and energy value of digestate from anaerobic digestion of trout byproducts: Contribution to the autonomy of freshwater farms in Morocco,"Anaerobic digestion is a technology used to treat organic waste and recover biogas and digestate. In this study, three subjects were investigated: agronomic and microbiological characterization of the digestate obtained at the end of anaerobic digestion, co-digestion of rainbow trout byproducts (RTBP) and their digestate, and a combined pre-treatment (thermal pre-treatment of RTBP at 110 degrees C for 30 min followed by co-digestion with their digestate). Experiments were carried out in biodigesters operating at mesophilic temperature and with batch feeding mode. The results showed that the digestate is rich in the nutrients required for plant development, and also contains fungi (mycelial fungi, yeasts) that break down organic compounds and help maintain the soil's biological stability. The methane yield for co-digestion was 289.44 Nml/g.VS with a biodegradability of 64.34 %, while for combined pre-treatment, the methane yield was 267.95 Nml/g.VS with a biodegradability of 60.46 %. Five kinetic models were used in this research to estimate theoretical methane production (Modified Gompertz, First order, Transference function, Modified Richard, and Logistic function). The two models, Modified Richard and Logistic function, presented results identical and close to those of the study that dealt with co-digestion, whose methane yield was 294.45 Nml/g.VS; and for combined pretreatment, the Modified Gompertz model showed a methane yield equal to 262.97 Nml/g.VS and is the closest to the experimental one.","Essalhi, F; Naourani, A; Essadek, A; Bengueddour, R",Anaerobic digestion; Digestate; Biofertilizers; Microorganisms; Thermal pretreatment; Co-digestion; Kinetic modeling,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rineng.2024.102508,Physical,thermal,,animal byproduct,trout waste,,,,,,,,,
Optimisation of biochar dose in anaerobic co-digestion of green algae and cattle manure using artificial neural networks and response surface methodology,"This study aimed to optimise and model biogas yields using artificial neural networks (ANN) and response surface method (RSM) of biogas yields after adding different doses of ozonation and ultrasonic pretreated biochar (BC) doses to the co-digestion of cattle manure and green algae substrates, with and without S.Parkle culture in the environment. The results of the RSM-D optimal design indicated that, in the absence of S.Parkle culture in the environment, the optimum ultrasonic pretreated biochar (UPBC) doses were 29.23 mg (for 100 mL digestion volume) and the corresponding optimum biogas yield was 340.50 mL/g volatile solids (VS). In the case of S. Parkle culture in the environment, the optimum ozonation pretreated biochar (OPBC) dose was 55.96 mg and the corresponding optimum biogas yield was 660.40 mL/g VS. ANN and RSM model performances were analyzed using different statistical indicators and ANN result obtain showed absolute percentage error (MAPE) value of 2.1, mean average error (MAE) value of 0.347, standard error of prediction (SEP) value of 0.590, and root-meansquare error (RMSE) value of 0.55, mean squared error (MSE) value of 0.31, the sum of the squared estimate of errors (SSE) value of 4.9 and coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.9999, and RSM result reveals MAPE of 0.0030, MAE value of 30.693, SEP value of 45.57, RMSE of 42.63, MSE value of 1817.6, SSE value of 29,081 and R2 of 0.9612. The model performance indicators and estimation results indicate that the ANN performs relatively better than the RSM in modelling the process. It is recommended that the optimum OPBC and UPBC doses be tested and verified on different substrates.","Senol, H; Çolak, E; Elibol, EA; Hassaan, MA; El Nemr, A",Anaerobic digestion; Methane; Yoon 's algorithm; Ultrasonic pretreatment; Ozonation pretreatment; Sawdust,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.152750,Process improvement,desinhibition,biochar,codigestion,algae+manure,,,,,,,,,
Evaluation of initial pH and urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) co-pretreatment on waste-activated sludge,"Wastewater treatment and conversion into renewable energy sources have been of great interest in recent times due to growing environmental pollution concerns and need for sustainable energy sources. Sewage sludge treatment can convert sludge into renewable energy. In this study, the impact of initial pH and urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP) co-pretreatment on sludge hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion was investigated. The pH of sludge was initially adjusted to 7, 9, and 11 before the addition of 8 mmol/g VS UHP. Under 24 h pretreatment, alkaline medium and UHP effectively enhanced sludge solubilization and hydrolysis. The combination of chemical, sonication, and centrifugation improved the extraction of extracellular polymerase substances released in soluble state. Secondly, anaerobic digestion was performed for 11 days to determine the influence of a lower mesophilic temperature (20 degree celsius) and retention time on the pretreated sludge. The highest NH4+-N concentration of 5.32 g/L was recorded in pH 7+UHP. The most significant total VFA concentration of 13.1 g COD/L was observed in pH 7+UHP on day 9. Acetic acid, isovaleric acid and propionic acid accounted for 80%-83% of the total VFA composition in all pretreated reactors. Lower mesophilic temperature efficiently optimized UHP and VFA production in the pretreated reactors. Microbial metabolism was stabilized under a longer retention time. Alkaline pH and longer retention time elevated NH4+-N and VFA concentration. The results showed that initial pH and UHP co-pretreatment of waste activated sludge offer an alternative pathway for enhancing sludge hydrolysis and VFA production applicable in sludge treatment.","Baffoe, EE; Otoo, SL; Kareem, S; Dankwah, JR",Urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP); pH; Pretreatment; Anaerobic digestion; Extracellular polymerase substances (EPS); VFA,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2024.118155,Chemical,oxidizer,urea hydrogen peroxide,activated sludge,dewatered sludge,,,,,,,,,
Energy Integration of Thermal Pretreatment in Anaerobic Digestion of Wheat Straw,"Cereal straw stands out as one of the most abundant and globally distributed agricultural residues. Traditional applications cope with a limited amount of production, leaving the remainder in the field for natural decomposition. Managing cereal straw through controlled biological transformation under anaerobic conditions holds the potential to generate added value in the form of bioenergy. However, the lignocellulosic composition of these substrates poses challenges for organic degradation, often requiring energy-intensive pretreatments. A detailed study with a comprehensive calculation of the overall energy balance of the integrated process is proposed, aiming to provide real added value and replicability. Three scenarios for wheat straw transformation were investigated, incorporating two preliminary pre-treatment stages-mechanical milling and physicochemical steam explosion. Three conditions of pretreatment were essayed, varying the time exposure of the steam explosion. The subsequent energy integration analysis revealed that the process was optimized by up to 15% in the final energy balance when the steam explosion was set to 10 min. The macromolecular composition determination revealed that the thermal pretreatment reduced the lag phase of the hydrolysis step through hemicellulose breakdown.","Alvaro, AG; Palomar, CR; Villalobos, ID; Hermosilla, D; Munoz, R; de Godos, I",anaerobic digestion; biogas; cereal straw; energy integration; thermal pretreatment; steam explosion; waste to energy,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en17092030,Physical,thermal,,lignocellulose,wheat,straw,,,,,,,,
Performance Evaluation of Different Clustering Techniques and Parameters of Hybrid PSO- and GA-ANFIS on Optimization and Prediction of Biomethane Yield of Alkali-Pretreated Groundnut Shells,"The study focuses on optimizing biomethane yield in the anaerobic digestion of alkali-pretreated groundnut shells, involving varied input parameters. Biomethane optimization will improve the economy of the technology, which will assist in managing the environmental challenges of fossil fuel combustion. Traditional methods prove challenging, inaccurate, and uneconomical, necessitating efficient optimization models. This research hybridizes particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithms (GA) with adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models, assessing input parameters' influence on biomethane yield through renowned performance metrics. Comparing the best model in the hybrid analysis, encompassing pretreatments A-E, the PSO-ANFIS (RMSE = 1.1719, MADE = 0.6525, MAE = 0.9314, Theil's U = 0.1844, and SD = 0.7737) outperformed the GA-ANFIS (RMSE = 1.9338, MADE = 0.9318, MAE = 1.6557, Theil's U = 0.2734, SD = 1.0598), using the same cluster radius of 0.50. Furthermore, compared to the GA-ANFIS model, the PSO-ANFIS model demonstrated significant improvements across various metrics: RMSE by 39.40%, MADE by 29.97%, MAE by 43.75%, Theil's U by 32.56%, and SD by 27.00%. Results indicate that the PSO-ANFIS model outperforms the GA-ANFIS model, emphasizing the importance of suitable clustering algorithms and precise parameter adjustment for optimal performance in predicting biomethane yield from pretreated lignocellulose feedstocks.","Olatunji, KO; Oladipo, SO; Madyira, DM; Sun, Y",Anaerobic digestion; Lignocellulose feedstocks; Pretreatment; Biomethane; Prediction; Hybrid models; PSO and GA-ANFIS,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-024-02674-2,Chemical,alkaline,NaOH,lignocellulose,groundnut,shells,,,,,,,,
Biochemical Methane Potential of Mechanically and Enzymatically Pretreated Solid Olive Mill Waste,"Olive cake, the solid byproduct of three-phase centrifugation olive oil production, has a high organic and polyphenol content, rendering it an environmental threat when landfilled as well as limiting its animal feed potential. This residue can be a good candidate for biomethane production due to its rich polysaccharide content (pectin, hemicellulose, and cellulose). Two strategies were compared to maximize biomethane production: destoning (i.e., removal of the seed fragments via mechanical means) and enzymatic pretreatment of the pulp. After 30 days of batch anaerobic digestion at 35 degrees C, both enzymatically pretreated and destoned olive cakes produced similar amounts of methane (similar to 295 mL CH4/g volatile solids (VS)), 42% more than the control. A comparison of olive cake's biomethane yields with a broad range of agricultural residues in the literature demonstrated its suitability for biomethane production. Additionally, the digestate recovered from the anaerobic digestion of olive cake had high Kjeldahl nitrogen contents (3.6%, db) and low polyphenol concentrations (0.02 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g), qualifying it as an ingredient for soil amendment. This study demonstrated olive cake can be diverted from landfills for second-generation biofuel production, and that the resulting digestate may have value for soil amendment.","Tai, P; Spierling, R; Carroll, J; Jung, S",enzymatic pretreatment; anaerobic digestion; olive cake; biomethane; digestate; olive oil,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr11030865,Biological,enzyme,,food waste,olive,cake,,,,,,,,
Effect of Alkaline and Mechanical Pretreatment of Wheat Straw on Enrichment Cultures from Pachnoda marginata Larva Gut,"In order to partially mimic the efficient lignocellulose pretreatment process performed naturally in the gut system of Pachnoda marginata larvae, two wheat straw pretreatments were evaluated: a mechanical pretreatment via cutting the straw into two different sizes and an alkaline pretreatment with calcium hydroxide. After pretreatment, gut enrichment cultures on wheat straw at alkaline pH were inoculated and kept at mesophilic conditions over 45 days. The methanogenic community was composed mainly of the Methanomicrobiaceae and Methanosarcinaceae families. The combined pretreatment, size reduction and alkaline pretreatment, was the best condition for methane production. The positive effect of the straw pretreatment was higher in the midgut cultures, increasing the methane production by 192%, while for hindgut cultures the methane production increased only by 149% when compared to non-pretreated straw. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the alkaline pretreatment modified the surface of the wheat straw fibers, which promoted biofilm formation and microbial growth. The enrichment cultures derived from larva gut microbiome were able to degrade larger 1 mm alkaline treated and smaller 250 mu m but non-pretreated straw at the same efficiency.

The decomposition of the compact biomass structure was analyzed through Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FT-IR) and X-ray Diffractometer (XRD). Moreover, the electron transfer capability in the system was evaluated by electrochemical analysis. The systematic experiment yielded the highest methane production at a pressure of 400Mpa, reaching 227.67 mL/g VS.

Cumulative methane yields of 222.92, 214.00, 171.02, 140.99, and 261.36 ml -CH4/g -VSadded were recorded for thermal, alkali, acid, nanoparticle additive, and combined pretreatment methods, which represents 112.77, 70.03, 40.18, and 159.85% improvement compared to the untreated substrate (100.58 ml -CH4/g -VSadded). Combined pretreatment was found to release the highest cumulative yield, and thermal pretreatment produced the least retention period.

Comparative Analysis of the Effects of Five Pretreatment Methods on Morphological and Methane Yield of Groundnut Shells,"Agricultural residues have been identified as potential substrates for anaerobic digestion, which indicates them as alternative energy sources. But enzymatic hydrolysis of these residues has been observed as the rate-limiting step due to their recalcitrant characteristics.

However, the recalcitrant structure of DPC affects the yield of products in bioprocesses. To boost the accessibility of the structure as well as increase the soluble fraction of carbohydrates and facilitate further enzymatic hydrolysis, hydrothermal and dilute acid (0.5% (v/v) sulfuric acid) pretreatments as cost-effective and feasible methods were applied on DPC at relatively low temperatures (80, 100, 120 and 140 degrees C) and reaction times (60 and 90 min).

Investigation into the treatment and resource recovery of rifamycin mycelial dreg with thermal alkaline pretreatment-anaerobic digestion,"Rifamycin, a highly potent drug for the treatment of tuberculosis should raise environmental concerns due to its massive production of mycelial dreg (RMD). The RMD treatment by anaerobic digestion (AD) is a highly promising endeavor, but has still far from explicit.

Enhancement of methane production by electrohydrolysis pretreatment for anaerobic digestion of OFMSW,"Hydrolysis is the most critical rate-limiting step in the anaerobic digestion (AD) process for most types of substrates. The organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) is a rich source for the AD process because of its high degradability. In this study, electrohydrolysis pretreatment was investigated for the OFMSW to overcome the rate-limiting step of hydrolysis. Electrohydrolysis pretreatment was applied to the OFMSW for 30 and 60 min in a custom-made reactor. In the untreated, 30-min. treated, and 60-min. treated OFMSW average methane production was observed as 225 +/- 2 mL CH4/g VSadded, 231 +/- 4 mL CH4/g VSadded, and 248 +/- 7 mL CH4/g VSadded, respectively. By increasing the treatment time, the lag phase, during which hydrolysis occurs, was reduced by 40-43%. 3-10% more methane was produced by applying electrohydrolysis pretreatment. These results suggest that electrohydrolysis pretreatment is a promising method to improve the efficiency of AD for the OFMSW by reducing the time required for hydrolysis and increasing methane production. More investigation is required to better comprehend the effects of electrohydrolysis on the OFMSW.","Kabakci, Y; Kosar, S; Dogan, O; Uctug, FG; Arikan, OA",Anaerobic digestion; Biochemical methane potential (BMP); Electrohydrolysis; Organic fraction of municipal solid waste; (OFMSW); Pretreatment,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2023.117534,Physical,electrolysis,,ofmsw,municipal s,,,,,,,,,
Effect of Ammonia-Autoclave Pretreatment on the Performance of Corn Straw and Cow Manure Batch Anaerobic Digestion,"Biomass pretreatment is a critical method for improving the anaerobic digestion (AD) performance of lignocellulosic feedstocks. In this study, an effective combined ammonia-autoclave pretreatment method was selected for the pretreatment of corn straw at 90 degrees C using four ammonia concentrations (7%, 9%, 11%, and 13%). The results showed that the combined pretreatment improved the substrate's degradation efficiency and the system's buffer capacity, and significantly improved the hydrolysis and biogas production performance of corn straw. After pretreatment, the lignin removal rate increased by 11.28-39.69%, and the hemicellulose degradation rate increased from 10.12% to 21.23%. Pretreatment of corn straw with 9% ammonia and an autoclave gave the highest methane yield of 257.11 mL/gVS, which was 2.32-fold higher than that of untreated corn straw, making it the optimal pretreatment condition for corn straw.

Hydrothermal Pre- and Intertreatment for Anaerobic Digestion of Municipal Sludge,"In this study, the effect of hydrothermal treatment (HTT) and the evaluation of its application as a pretreatment (HTP) and inter-treatment (HIT) on anaerobic digestion (AD) and fermentation of thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS) were examined. Two configurations were tested: (1) hydrothermal pretreatment, where the hydrothermal treatment was applied prior to single and two-stage anaerobic digestion; and (2) hydrothermal inter-treatment, where the hydrothermal treatment was applied after the first stage, fermentation, and prior to the second stage, methanogenesis. The results revealed the positive impact of hydrothermal pretreatment in both fermentation and anaerobic digestion processes. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) solubilization was higher through HTP (25.5%) than HIT (13%). Hydrothermal pretreatment increased the volatile fatty acids (VFA) production by 40% compared to the raw sample. The results also revealed no significant differences in the methane yield when hydrothermal treatment was applied as pretreatment or inter-treatment. The methane yield for the hydrothermal pretreatment and hydrothermal inter-treatment scenarios were 230 mLCH(4)/gTCOD(added )and 227 mLCH(4)/g TCODadded, respectively, compared to158 mLCH(4)/gTCOD(added )for the raw sample.","Kakar, FL; Liss, SN; Elbeshbishy, E",Anaerobic digestion (AD); Volatile fatty acids (VFA); Fermentation; Hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP); Hydrothermal inter-treatment (HIT),2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0002051,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,activated sludge,municipal sludge,,,,,,,,,
Comparative analysis of microwave wet torrefaction and anaerobic digestion for energy recovery from antibiotic mycelial residue,"Microwave wet torrefaction (MWT) and anaerobic digestion (AD) are two potential approaches to produce hydrochar fuel or methane energy from biomass. This study comparative analysed the preparation of hydrochar with MWT and biogas production with AD to recover energy and remove antibiotics from antibiotic mycelial residue (AMR). Moreover, MWT was also used as a pretreatment in AD to improve methanogenic performance. The results showed that abamectin was significantly removed by MWT and the highest degradation rate reached 95.0%. The volatiles of AMR, especially hemicellulose, were significantly degraded, and the structure of AMR became incompact and amorphous after MWT. For the preparation of hydrochar, higher temperature (200degree celsius) with long residence time (30 min) was recommended to obtain higher energy yield (>97.2%). Considering the abamectin removal, MWT at 160degree celsius is more suitable for pretreatment of AD, which obtained a higher methane production (327.9 mL/g VS) than the AD of raw AMR (234.0 mL/g VS).

Liquid hot water treatment of woody biomass at different temperatures: The effect on composition and energy production in the form of gaseous biofuels,"In the current study willow sawdust, a woody biomass (WB), was used as feedstock for batch methane and bio-hydrogen production following liquid hot water (LHW) treatment. LHW treatment was carried out for 15 min using a microwave equipment, at different temperatures (130, 180, 215 and 230 degrees C) and its effect was evaluated on both chemical composition and biofuels' yields. The results showed that high LHW temperature enhanced hemicellulose solubilization, whereas at the temperatures tested lignin and cellulose removal was limited. At LHW temperatures of 215 or 230 degrees C, the concentrations of sugars, furfural, 5-hydroxyl-methyl-furfural and acids increased, compared to the lower temperatures, but were not at inhibitory levels for the subsequent fermentation processes. Thus, fermentative hydrogen production from both the liquid and the solid fractions obtained from LHW pretreatment at 215 and 230 degrees C was 35.6 and 43.7 % higher, respectively, compared to the untreated WB, corresponding to the production of 11.8 +/- 0.7 and 12.5 +/- 0.1 LH2/100 g TSraw (TSraw: total solids of untreated biomass). Similarly, at 215 and 230 degrees C, the biochemical methane potential of both pretreated fractions was 42.2 and 48.8 % higher than the untreated WB, corresponding respectively to 18.7 +/- 0.5 and 18.9 +/- 0.5 LCH4/100 g TSraw.","Antonopoulou, G; Papadopoulou, K; Alexandropoulou, M; Lyberatos, G",Liquid hot water pretreatment; Woody biomass; Willow sawdust; Temperature; Dark fermentation; Anaerobic digestion; Methane; Hydrogen,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scp.2024.101485,Physical,thermal,microwave liquid hot water,wood,wood chips,,,,,,,,,
Improvement of Asterarcys quadricellulare biomass solubilization and subsequent biogas production via pretreatment approaches: structural changes and kinetic modeling evaluation,"This study investigated the effect of enzymatic and hydrothermal pretreatment approaches on the solubilization of organic matter, structure, and biogas yield from microalgal biomass. The soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD) concentration increased by 1.21-3.30- and 5.54-6.60-fold compared to control by enzymatic and hydrothermal pretreatments respectively. The hydrothermal pretreatment affected the structural changes in the microalgal biomass markedly; nonetheless, increased enzymatic concentration also had a definite effect on it as determined by qualitative approaches like scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Also, the hydrothermal pretreatment (100 degrees C for 30 min) resulted in the highest biogas production potential (P) of 765.37 mLg(-1) VS at a maximum biogas production rate (R-m) of 22.66 mLg(-1) day(-1) with a very short lag phase (lambda) of 0.07 days. The biogas production of pretreated microalgal biomass particularly at higher enzyme dose (20%, 24 h) and higher hydrothermal pretreatment temperature (120 degrees C, 30 min) showed a significant but weak correlation (R = 0.53) with sCOD, thus demonstrating that the less organic matter was used up for the biogas production. The modified Gompertz model explained the anaerobic digestion of microalgal biomass more accurately and had a better fit to the experimental data comparatively because of the low root mean square error (3.259-16.728), residual sum of squares (78.887-177.025), and Akaike's Information Criterion (38.605-62.853).","Dar, RA; Phutela, UG",Anaerobic digestion; Biogas yield; Enzymatic and hydrothermal pretreatment; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Soluble chemical oxygen demand; Microalgal biomass,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-26555-8,Biological,enzyme,,micro-algae,Asterarcys,,,,,,,,,

Both AD systems were capable of operating at very short hydraulic retention times (HRTs) to as low as about 3 days, and very high methane production rates were achieved. However, much higher methane production was obtained in the TPAD system. The phase separation of the acidogenesis and the methanogenesis in the TPAD system not only increased methane production but also maintained reactor stability throughout the experimental period.

Hydrothermal pre-treatment followed by anaerobic digestion for the removal of tylosin and antibiotic resistance agents from poultry litter,"Hydrothermal pretreatment (HPT) followed by anaerobic digestion (AD) is an alternative for harvesting energy and removing organic contaminants from sewage sludge and animal manure. This study investigated the use, in an energetically sustainable way, of HPT and AD, alone or combined, to produce methane and remove tylosin and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG) from poultry litter (PL). The results showed that HPT at 80 degrees C (HPT80), followed by single-stage AD (AD-1S), led to the production of 517.9 +/- 4.7 NL CH4 kg VS-1, resulting in 0.11 kWh kg PL-1 of electrical energy and 0.75 MJ kg PL-1 of thermal energy, thus supplying 33.6% of the energy spent on burning firewood at a typical farm. In this best-case scenario, the use of HPT alone reduced tylosin concentration from PL by 23.6%, while the process involving HPT followed by AD-1S led to the removal of 91.6% of such antibiotic. The combined process (HPT80 + AD-1S), in addition to contributing to reduce the absolute and relative abundances of ARG ermB (2.13 logs), intI1 (0.39 logs), sul1 (0.63 logs), and tetA (0.74 logs), led to a significant removal in the relative abundance of tylosin-resistant bacteria present in the poultry litter.","Paranhos, AGD; Pereira, AR; Coelho, LDN; Silva, SD; De Aquino, SF",Hydrothermal pretreatment; Antibiotic resistance genes; Antibiotic-resistant bacteria; Tylosin; Single-stage anaerobic digestion; Energetic viability,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-25329-6,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,manure,chicken,litter,,,,,,,,
Ascorbic acid reduction pretreatment enhancing metal regulation to improve methane production from anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge,"Conversion of waste activated sludge (WAS) to methane by anaerobic digestion (AD) is often limited by the slow rate of hydrolysis, and the presence of metal ions in sludge is regarded as a critical factor hindering sludge hydrolysis. This study developed a novel strategy to remove Fe from WAS by using ascorbic acid (VC) as a reducing agent under acidic conditions. The feasibility of reduction pretreatment in improving methane pro-duction of AD and its intrinsic mechanism were investigated. Results indicate that, under VC doses of 100 mmol/ L and pH of 3.50, pretreatment removed 47.60 % of Fe, 59.88 % of Ca, and 51.86 % of Mg contained in the sludge. The removal of metal ions facilitated the disruption of sludge flocculation structure and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) layers, leading to a 14.78 % increase in cell lysis and a decrease in fractal dimension values to 2.08. Batch AD experiments showed that VC pretreatment improved methane production, with an optimized net methane yield of 190.22 mL/g & sdot;VS, an increase of 134.75 % compared to raw WAS. The pre-treatment affected the interfacial interaction energy of the sludge, leading to a transformation in the sludge surfaces from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, reducing the interaction between sludge molecules and increasing the number of binding sites available for enzymatic reactions. According to a study of microbial communities, it was found that VC pretreatment caused an increase in the presence of essential functional microbes responsible for hydrolysis, acidification, and methanation. This increase in acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens resulted in a substantial enhancement in methane production. These results can be used to develop better pre-treatment methods to enhance AD performance.","Li, SQ; Zhang, Y; Liu, M; Du, ZX; Li, JZ; Gu, L; Xu, LJ; Liu, F",Reduction pretreatment; Waste activated sludge; Anaerobic digestion; Metal content; Methane production,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169185,Chemical,acidic,ascorbic,activated sludge,secondary sludge,,,,,,,,,
Understanding the mechanism of enhanced anaerobic biodegradation of biodegradable plastics after alkaline pretreatment,"Biodegradable plastics (BPs) tend to replace conventional plastics, which increases the amount of BP waste entering the environment. The anaerobic environment exists extensively in nature, and anaerobic digestion has become a widely used technique for organic waste treatment. Many kinds of BPs have low biodegradability (BD) and biodegra-dation rates under anaerobic condition due to the limitation of hydrolysis, so they still have harmful environmental consequences in anaerobic environment. There is an urgent need to find an intervention method to improve the bio-degradation of BPs. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of alkaline pretreatment in accelerating the thermophilic anaerobic degradation of ten widely used BPs, such as poly (lactic acid) (PLA), poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), thermoplastic starch (TPS), poly (butylene succinate-co-butylene adipate) (PBSA), cellulose diacetate (CDA), etc. The results showed that NaOH pretreatment significantly improved the solubility of PBSA, PLA, poly (propylene carbonate) (PPC), and TPS. Except for PBAT, pretreatment with an appropriate NaOH con-centration could improve the BD and degradation rate. The pretreatment also reduced the lag phase in the anaerobic degradation of BPs such as PLA, PPC, and TPS. Specifically, for CDA and PBSA, the BD increased from 4.6 % and 30.5 % to 85.2 % and 88.7 %, with increments of 1752.2 % and 190.8 %, respectively. Microbial analysis indicated that NaOH pretreatment promoted the dissolution and hydrolysis of PBSA and PLA and the deacetylation of CDA, which contributed to rapid and complete degradation. This work not only provides a promising method for improving the degradation of BP waste but also lays the foundation for its large-scale application and safe disposal.","Jin, Y; Sun, X; Song, C; Cai, FF; Liu, GQ; Chen, C",Biodegradable plastics; Alkaline pretreatment; Anaerobic digestibility; Methane production; Solubility; Microbial community,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162324,Chemical,alkaline,NaOH,other,bioplastic,,,,,,,,,
Improving antibiotic removal and anaerobic digestion performance of discarded cefradine pellets through thermo-alkaline pretreatment,"Discarded cefradine pellets (DCP) as the hazardous wastes contain lots of bioavailable sucrose. Anaerobic digestion (AD) may be a promising technology for treating DCP, achieving dual goals of waste treatment and resource recovery. However, high concentration of cefradine will inhibit the AD process. This study applied thermo-alkaline pretreatment (TAP) to remove cefradine and improve the AD performance of DCP. Around 95% cefradine could be degraded to different intermediate degradation products (TPs) in TAP at optimal condition, and hydrolysis and hydrogenation were the main degradation pathways. Quantitative structure -activity relationship analysis indicated that the main TPs exhibited lower toxicity than cefradine, and DCP residues after TAP were almost not toxic to E. coli K12 and B. subtilis growth by antibacterial activity analysis. Therefore, TAP promoted the biomethane yield in AD of DCP residues (274.74 mL/g COD), which was 1.91 times that of control group. Besides, compared to control group, final cefradine concentrations in liquids and sludge were significantly decreased in AD system with TAP, lowering environmental risk and indicating stronger prospect for process application. Microbiological analysis revealed that acidogens (Macellibacteroides, Bacteroides), syntrophs (Syn- trophobacter, Syntrophorhabdus), and acetoclastic Methanosaeta were enriched in AD system with TAP, which contributed to improving AD performance of DCP.","Shi, YS; Pang, BY; Jia, YY; Quan, HT; Zhang, N; Deng, QJ; Yan, YJ; Ji, FH; Sun, LP; Lu, H",Anaerobic digestion; Thermo -alkaline pretreatment; Discarded cefradine pellets; Cefradine degradation; Toxicological analysis,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.133394,Physical,thermal,,other,medical drugs,discarded cefradine pellets,,,,,,,,

Hydrothermal but Not Mechanical Pretreatment of Wastewater Algae Enhanced Anaerobic Digestion Energy Balance due to Improved Biomass Disintegration and Methane Production Kinetics,"This study used pilot-scale high-rate algae ponds to assess algal-bacteria biomass productivity and wastewater nutrient removal as well as the impact of mechanical and hydrothermal pretreatments on biomass disintegration, methane production kinetics, and anaerobic digestion (AD) energy balance. Mechanical pretreatment had a minor effect on biomass disintegration and methane production. By contrast, hydrothermal pretreatment significantly reduced particle size and increased the solubilized organic matter content by 3.5 times. The methane yield and production rate increased by 20-55% and 20-85%, respectively, with the highest values achieved after pretreatment at 121 degrees C for 60 min.

Improvements in the anaerobic digestion of biological sludge from pulp and paper mills using thermal pretreatment,"The current disposal of biosludge generated in wastewater treatment has high costs and causes environmental problems, anaerobic digestion (AD) of solid waste is a promising alternative. Thermal hydrolysis (TH) is an accepted technology to enhance anaerobic biodegradability of sewage sludge, but this technology has not been developed to be used with biological sludge from industrial wastewater treatment. In this work, the improvements to the AD of biological sludge from cellulose industry when thermal pretreatment is carried out were experimentally determined. The experimental conditions for TH were 140 degrees C and 165 degrees C for 45 minutes. Batch tests were carried out to quantify methane production evaluated as biomethane potential (BMP), anaerobic biodegradability according to volatile solids (VS) consumption and kinetic adjustments. An innovative kinetic model based on the serial mechanism of fast and slow biodegradation fractions was tested for untreated waste, and parallel mechanism was also evaluated. Increases in BMP and biodegradability values according to VS consumption were determined with increasing TH temperature. The results of 241 NmL CH4 gVS substrate(-1) for BMP and 65% biodegradability are reported for the 165 degrees C treatment. AD rate increased for the TH waste compared to the untreated biosludge. Improvements of up to 159% for BMP and 260% for biodegradability according to VS consumption were quantified for TH biosludge compared to untreated biosludge.","Goycoechea, N; Borges, I; Castello, E; Borzacconi, L",Anaerobic digestion; biological sludge; pulp and paper industry; kinetic models; methane; thermal pretreatment,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0734242X231154198,Physical,thermal,,lignocellulose,paper pulp,processing waste,,,,,,,,
Enhancing Single- and Two-Stage Anaerobic Digestion of Thickened Waste-Activated Sludge through FNA-Heat Pretreatment,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of combined Free Nitrous Acid (FNA)-Heat (i.e., FNH) pretreatment on single- and two-stage anaerobic digestion (AD) of thickened waste-activated sludge (TWAS). Single-stage AD was conducted in batches, while two-stage AD involved acidogenic fermentation under semi-continuous flow followed by batch methanogenesis. FNH pretreatment was applied before the acidogenic stage, using 1.4 mg HNO2-N/L FNA concentration at 25 degrees C, 37 degrees C, and 60 degrees C for 24 h. Among the scenarios, the most promising results were observed with two-stage AD fed with FNH-pretreated TWAS at 60 degrees C, showing higher COD solubilization and a reduction in volatile solids. Combined FNA-Heat pretreatment in two-stage AD yielded elevated methane production (363-415 mL CH4/g VS added) compared to single-stage digestion. Methane yields from FNA-Heat pretreated single-stage ranged from 332 to 347 mL CH4/g VS added, contrasting with 212 mL CH4/g VS added for untreated TWAS. Methane generation commenced early in both untreated and pretreated samples, attributed to soluble substrate abundance.","Chegini, S; Elbeshbishy, E",two-stage anaerobic digestion; thermochemical pretreatment; acidogenic fermentation; solubilization; methane production; thickened waste-activated sludge,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr12020345,Chemical,acidic,free nitrous acid,activated sludge,thickened waste activated sludge,,,,,,,,,

The pretreated bio-plastic with MtOH-ZnOAc performs efficient solubilization and produced 205.7 & PLUSMN; 6.9 mL/g CODadded, which is higher than thermal alkaline degradation. The mesophilic condition produces more than 79% higher biogas compared with the thermophilic condition with the diluted pretreated bioplastic by 30 times. The kinetic study was well fit the experimental data and showed the correlation between cumulative biogas, production rate, and lag phase with mono-and two-stage system in batch fermentation. The two-stage system produced 315.6 & PLUSMN; 7.7 mL/g CODadded which was higher 67.2 & PLUSMN; 2.02 than the mono-stage system.

Sodium Hydroxide Hydrothermal Extraction of Lignin from Rice Straw Residue and Fermentation to Biomethane,"The purpose of the NaOH pretreatment of rice straw with a recycling strategy was to enhance the economic efficiency of producing biomethane. Anaerobic digestion is used for converting rice straw into biogas. In this work, 5% NaOH and rice straw mixed samples were autoclaved at 121 C-? for 20 min for lignin removal. The NaOH black liquor was separated using filtration for the subsequent treatment cycle. The NaOH liquor was utilized in one more subsequent recycling procedure to test its ability to remove lignin from the rice straw. The 5% NaOH treatment results in a reduction in rice straw (RC) lignin of 73.6%. The lignin content of the recycled NaOH-filtrated rice straw samples (RCF1) was reduced by 55.5%. The 5% NaOH-treated rice straw sample yields a total cumulative biogas of 1452.4 mL/gVS, whereas the recycled NaOH-filtered (RCF1) samples generate 1125.2 mL/gVS after 30 days of incubation. However, after 30 days of incubation, the untreated rice straw (RCC) bottle produced a total of 285.5 mL/gVS of biogas. The total increase in methane output after NaOH treatment is 6-8 times greater, and the biogas yield improves by 80-124%. We show here that the recycled NaOH black solution has still the effectiveness to be used for successive pretreatment cycles to remove lignin and generate methane. In the meantime, the NaOH black solution contains useful materials (lignin, sugars, potassium, and nitrogen) that could be purified for commercial purposes, and more importantly recycling the NaOH solution decrease the chances of environmental pollution. Thus, recycling NaOH decreased chemical consumption, which would provide net benefits instead of using fresh NaOH solution, had a lower water consumption, and provided the prospect of producing an optimum yield of methane in anaerobic digestion. This method will decrease the chemical treatment costs for biomass pretreatment prior to anaerobic digestion. Recycling of NaOH solution and the integration of pretreatment reactors could be a novel bioprocessing addition to the current technology.","Shah, TA; Khalid, S; Nafidi, HA; Salamatullah, AM; Bourhia, M",lignin; straw; heating; NaOH; pretreatment; biogas,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15118755,Chemical,alkaline,NaOH,lignocellulose,rice,straw,,,,,,,,
Enhancing biogas production through photocatalytic pretreatment of rice straw co-digested with cow dung and food waste using a novel g-C3N4/ SiO2/bentonite catalyst,"This study investigates the application of a novel composite photocatalyst, g-C3N4/SiO2/ Bentonite, for rice straw pretreatment, aiming to enhance biogas production in anaerobic digestion. The photocatalytic pretreatment disrupts rice straw's lignin and hemicellulose structures, reducing silica content for improved microbial degradation. Five 2 L anaerobic digesters were employed with rice straw as the substrate and co-digestion materials, including cow dung and food waste. Rice straw treated with the g-C3N4/7.5% SiO2/5% Bentonite catalyst exhibited a remarkable 37% increase in methane yield compared to untreated rice straw. This photocatalytic process led to a 31% increase in cellulose content and a 30% reduction in lignin after 6 hours of pretreatment. Simultaneously, silica content in the rice straw decreased to 6.4% after 6 hours, resulting in a 48% increase in the carbon proportion. These findings underscore the potential of integrated photocatalysts for significantly enhancing biogas production efficiency through the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass.","Tamilselvan, R; Selwynraj, I",Biogas; Photocatalyst; Pretreatment; Rice Straw; Oxidation,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psep.2024.05.017,Chemical,oxidation,photooxidation g-C3N4SiO2bentonite,lignocellulose,rice,straw,,,,,,,,
Visible light driven g-C3N4 photocatalytic pretreatment of rice straw for enhanced biogas production,"This study investigates the utilization of Graphitic Carbon Nitride (g-C3N4) as a photocatalytic material for enhancing biofuel production from rice straw, an agricultural residue with potential for sustainable energy generation. The melamine-synthesized g-C3N4 is used as a pretreatment agent, where rice straw is immersed in a g-C3N4 solution and exposed to 450-600 nm solar irradiation for varying durations. This pretreatment process modifies the biomass structure, resulting in a reduction of the silica content to 72.05% and an increase in the carbon percentage to 41.58% within the rice straw. Methane production demonstrates the effectiveness of g-C3N4-based pretreatment, with methane production from raw rice straw at 231 mL/g(VS).

A novel g-C3N4 photocatalytic pretreatment for reducing silica and modifying the structure of rice straw for sustainable biofuel production,"The growing importance of biofuels as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels necessitates exploring effective utilization of abundant resources like rice straw, which currently contributes to environmental pollution through inefficient burning. This research focuses on harnessing the potential of g-C3N4 photocatalytic pretreatment to enhance rice straw's structure and improve biogas production. Detailed analysis employing FESEM, EDX, XRD, and FTIR techniques revealed substantial structural changes. Silica content decreased from 22.84 % in untreated rice straw to 18.05 % and 6.39 % after 3 and 6 h of treatment, respectively, while carbon content increased from 28.05 % to 38.54 % and 48.02 % during the same treatment durations. Significantly, methane production experienced a remarkable increase from 198.21 to 512.14 mL/g VS after 6 h of treatment, and the cellulose concentration in the biomass exhibited a substantial rise of 39 % compared to untreated samples.

Chicken Manure Pretreatment for Enhancing Biogas and Methane Production,"The objective of this work was to determine the potential of chicken manure as a substrate for biogas production after pretreatment. The effects of removing excess nitrogen from chicken manure by water extraction in a temperature range from 20 & DEG;C to 60 & DEG;C to increase methane production were investigated. The dynamics of the process and efficiency of biogas production were also analyzed. As a result of manure fermentation after pretreatment, 16 to 45% more biogas and 18 to 39% more methane were obtained compared to manure without pretreatment. The effect of extraction was to increase the ratio of carbon to nitrogen by 2-2.7 times, which contributed to increasing biogas efficiency. The proposed method seems to be a promising enhancing of biogas and methane production in comparison with raw chicken manure. Biomass in the form of chicken manure is a promising substrate for biogas production, due to the constantly growing poultry meat production as well as environmental aspects such as reducing gas emissions from manure into the atmosphere.","Konkol, I; Swierczek, L; Cenian, A",chicken manure; pretreatment; methane fermentation; biogas efficiency,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16145442,Process improvement,other,phase separation,manure,chicken,,,,,,,,,
Effects of nanobubble water on digestate soaking hydrolysis of rice straw,"This study investigated the performance of combined nanobubble water (NW) and digestate in the soaking hydrolysis process. Two types of NW (CO 2 NW and O 2 NW) with digestate were used to soak rice straw for 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 days. During soaking process, the volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentration in the treatment with O 2 NW and digestate for 3 days (O 2 NW-3 d) reached 7179.5 mg-HAc/L. Moreover, the highest specific methane yield (SMY) obtained in this treatment could reach 336.7 NmL/gVS. Although the addition of NW did not significantly increase SMY from digestate soaking, NW could accelerate the rate of methane production and reduce digestion time of T 80 . The enrichment of Enterobacter in the soaking process was observed when using CO 2 NW and O 2 NW as soaking solutions which played important roles in VFA production. This study provides a new insight into environment -friendly enhanced crop straw pretreatment, combining NW and digestate soaking hydrolysis.","Wang, EZ; Xing, F; Chen, PH; Zheng, YH; Lyu, T; Li, X; Xiong, W; Li, G; Dong, RJ; Guo, JB",Soaking pretreatment; Nanobubbles; Biogas production; Microbial community,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2024.130893,Process improvement,other,nanobubbles,lignocellulose,rice,straw,,,,,,,,
Enhancement of biogas production from sugarcane molasses-based distillery wastewater with electrocoagulation pretreatment using iron electrodes,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) of distillery wastewater (DW) is not optimal because DW contains too high chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations. This research aimed to enhance biogas yield from DW with electrocoagulation (EC) pretreatment using iron electrodes. The novelty of this study is the combination of EC-AD for producing biogas from DW. The EC pretreatment was operated at various current densities of 39.31, 47.17, and 55.03 mA/cm2 for 8 h.

Unleashing synergistic potential of microbially enhanced anaerobic co-digestion of petroleum refinery biosludge and yard waste: Impact of nutrient balance and microbial diversity,"Petroleum refinery sludge, an egregious solid residue generated from the wastewater treatment plants poses an environmental hazard owing to its intricate hydrocarbon composition, necessitating competent treatment for secure disposal. The study proposes a green solution through anaerobic co-digestion of nitrogen-rich petroleum refinery sludge (PS) with carbon-rich yard waste (YW), balancing the nutrients and moisture content for efficient microbial proliferation. Using Central Composite Design-Response Surface Methodology, 1 L batch experiments were conducted with varying carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios and pH to achieve maximum biogas yield within 50 days of co-digestion. However, the sluggish biogas recovery (40%) indicated a slow rate-limiting hydrolysis, necessitating pretreatment. Feedstock incubation with Bacillus subtilis IH1 strain, isolated from the microbiallyenriched PS, at 108 colony forming units (CFU) per mL for 5 days maximized the soluble chemical oxygen demand and volatile fatty acids by 2.2 and 1.4 folds respectively compared to untreated feedstock. Scale-up Bacillus subtilis aided co-digestion studies further augmented biogas by 76% against untreated monodigestion of PS with significant total petroleum hydrocarbons, emulsions, and lignocellulosic degradation. Further identification of major organic pollutants in the batch digestate revealed significant degradation of the toxic organic hydrocarbon pollutants apotheosizing the efficacy of the synergistic sustainable technique for the management of PS. Environmental implication: The effluent treatment plants (ETPs) of petroleum refining industries generate sludge which is a complex mixture of petroleum hydrocarbons, oilwater (O/W) emulsions and heavy metals. These petroleum hydrocarbon constituents can be linear/cyclic alkanes, polyaromatics, resins and asphaltenes, whose intricate composition is reportedly carcinogenic, cytogenic and mutagenic, classifying it as hazardous waste. Biological treatment of these sludge through anaerobic digestion leads to utilization of petroleum hydrocarbons with subsequent energy recovery. Co-digestion of these sludge with competent co-substrates leads to nutrient balance, diverse microbial proliferation and toxicant dilution. Microbially aided co-digestion further augments methane rendering a digestate with utmost pollutant degradation.","Choudhury, SP; Haq, I; Kalamdhad, AS",Biogas; C/N ratio; Bacterial pretreatment; Hydrocarbons; Lignocellulose,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132361,Biological,enzyme,,codigestion,"Oil-sludge,yard waste",,,,,,,,,

The results were statistically proved using a 3D response surface graph, where the pretreatment was more effective for smaller particle sizes. The reduction in particle size also increased the CH4 production, which was more pronounced at the strong pretreatment (24 % increment vs. 10-15 %).

The pretreatment performances of thermal (TM), microwave (MW), and ultrasound (US) technologies and the AcoD performance were statistically and experimentally evaluated at various mixture ratios of CM, FW, and PM. The results revealed that the most effective pretreatment condition with the TM, MW, and US pretreatments was 129.3 degrees C for 49.6 min, 824.2 W for 7.3 min, and 418.0 W for 36.3 min, respectively. The best AcoD performance of optimally pretreated CM (PCM) was achieved when 30.5 % PCM was mixed with 42.5 % FW and 27.0 % PM. A long -term evaluation showed that the start -up rate for the anaerobic mono -digestion of PCM was 2.3 times faster than that of CM and the amount of methane produced was 4.7 times higher; process stability was thus preferentially maintained under a higher organic loading rate (OLR) (2.0 kg-VS/m 3 center dot d).

Enhanced anaerobic co-digestion of cattle manure with food waste and pig manure: Statistical optimization of pretreatment condition and substrate mixture ratio,"This study investigated the optimal pretreatment condition and mixture ratio of cattle manure (CM) for its efficient anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) with food waste (FW) and pig manure (PM). The pretreatment performances of thermal (TM), microwave (MW), and ultrasound (US) technologies and the AcoD performance were statistically and experimentally evaluated at various mixture ratios of CM, FW, and PM.

Anaerobic digestion of corn stover pretreated with sulfuric acid in different soaking durations,"The biogas production of pretreated corn stover has been determined in different soaking durations. Batch anaerobic digestion applies three different soaking durations in sulfuric acid pretreatment under room temperature. The study aimed to probe the effect of soaking durations during sulfuric acid pretreatment. The experiment was conducted in 600 mL digesters at room temperature. Biogas volume was measured using the water displacement method every three days. The observed cumulative biogas yields varied between 48.74 mL/g VS and 99.95 mL/g VS. The highest biogas yield was obtained when corn stover was soaked in sulfuric acid for 6 hours. The 24 h -pretreated corn stover got the lowest biogas yield. The statistical result proved a significant effect of soaking durations on biogas production (p < 0.05). The logistic model provided a better fit than the first -order model, with R2 values ranging from 0.9923 to 0.9987 and divergence between experimental and predicted values varying between 0.12% and 1.48%.","Shitophyta, LM; Arnita; Wulansari, HDA; Khan, A",Acid pretreatment; biogas; first-order model; kinetic; logistic model,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.30955/gnj.005229,Chemical,acidic,H2SO4,lignocellulose,corn,stover,,,,,,,,
Anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge using anaerobic dynamic membrane bioreactor under various sludge composition and organic loading rates,"This study investigates the effects of sludge compositions and organic loading rates (OLRs) on stable biogas production during sludge digestion.

The Role of Mild Alkaline Pretreatment in the Biorefinery Upgrade of Spent Coffee Grounds,"This work proposes a valorization route for spent coffee grounds (SCG), a widespread lignocellulosic residue, encompassing the production of: biomethane, lignin, and oligosaccharides as value-added products obtained simultaneously during a mild alkaline (NaOH) pretreatment. The studied operational variables were the reaction time (60-240 min), temperature (25-75 degrees C), and the NaOH concentration (0-2.5 M). The severity factor suitably describes the global process kinetics, with higher severities (log Mo = 5.5) yielding high product yields, 18.02% and 13.25% (on dry SCG basis) for lignin and oligosaccharides (XGMOS), respectively. Solid yield is negatively impacted by all studied variables (at the 95% confidence level). Conversely, XGMOS yield is positively influenced both by time and catalyst concentration, whereas lignin yield is only (positively) influenced by catalyst concentration. Optimal balance between product formation and potential operational costs is putatively achieved when using 0.625 M NaOH, at 50 degrees C for 60 min. The mild alkaline pretreated biomass (MAP-SCG) was compared to untreated SCG for biomethane production by anaerobic co-digestion with pig slurry (PS), using a ratio of biomass/PS = 1/3 (volatile solids (VS) basis). The proposed valorization route enabled the sequential production of 6.25 kg lignin, 6.36 kg oligosaccharides, and 138.05 kg biomethane per 100 kg of non-extracted SCG (and 287.60 kg pig slurry), in an integrated process that is technically feasible and promotes the circular bioeconomy.","Ribeiro, GM; Martins, PL; Oliveira, AC; Carvalheiro, F; Fragoso, R; Duarte, LC",biogas; biomass pretreatment; circular bioeconomy; lignin-derived products; oligosaccharides,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16093907,Chemical,alkaline,NaOH,lignocellulose,coffea,spent grounds,,,,,,,,
"Effect of Thermal, Acid and Alkaline Pretreatments on Biogas Production from Cattle Manure","This study examined biogas production from cattle manure obtained from Sivas (T & uuml;rkiye) province under anaerobic conditions.

Comparative Environmental and Economic Analysis of Biomethane Production from Co-Digestion of Rice Straw and Spent Mushroom Compost: Application of Zero-Valent Iron Nanoparticles,"Spent mushroom compost is one of the main potentials for biogas production.

According to the results, retention time (RT) and nanoparticle (NP) concentrations have the most significant impact on biomethane production (significant at 1% probability level), while the NaOH concentration has the lowest impact on biomethane production (significant at 5% probability level) in comparison with RT and NP concentration. Also, the maximum biomethane production is related to NP40Na15 (about 200% higher than the control). The minimum cumulative biomethane production is related to NP0Na15 (about 30% lower than the control). The lowest relative environmental midpoint impact is related to NP40Na15, which was on average about 60% lower than the control.

Delignification characteristics of rice straw pretreatment combining biogas slurry immersion with freeze-thaw,"The challenge associated with lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment is efficiently overcoming biomass recalcitrance at low cost and non-pollution. This study aims to make full use of the by-product biogas slurry rich in ammonia nitrogen and microorganisms from anaerobic digestion and the cold resources of winter in cold regions and propose a combined pretreatment method of biogas slurry immersion and then freeze-thaw. The physiochemical characteristics of pretreated rice straw were studied in terms of liquid-solid ratio, immersion temperature, immersion duration, and number of freeze-thaw cycles. Lignin removal first increased then decreased with increasing temperature and liquid-solid ratio during biogas slurry immersion and increased with prolonged immersion duration. Hydrolytic acidification bacteria played a more crucial pretreatment role during biogas slurry immersion than free ammonia. The freezing-thawing treatment could further break the chemical bonds between lignin and carbohydrates in the rice straw after soaking in biogas slurry and reduce the crystallinity of cellulose. The lignin removal gradually increased with the increase in the number of freezing-thawing repeated, and the maximal lignin removal from the rice straw undergoing biogas slurry immersion with a liquid-solid ratio of 15:1 at 30 degrees C for 3 days and then five freeze-thaw repetitions reached 59.90%, and its crystallinity index reduced by 17.23% compared to raw rice straw. The carbon to nitrogen ratio of pretreated rice straw decreased to below 25, and a certain amount of volatile fatty acids could be accumulated, respectively, after biogas slurry immersion and freeze-thaw. The combined pretreatment method of biogas slurry immersion and freeze-thaw would be a promising approach to promote the low-cost operation and large-scale production of the straw pretreatment and biogas industry, especially in regions with natural cold resources.","Wang, LL; Wang, ZC; Wang, ZJ; Zheng, Y",Rice straw; Pretreatment; Biogas slurry; Freezing-thawing; Lignin removal,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13399-024-06239-0,Physical,freezing,,lignocellulose,rice,straw,,,,,,,,

To achieve this, thermal acid pretreatment was carried out using equal proportions of blended wheat straw with coffee husks and subjected to the anaerobic digester with 0.3 g/L of neem leave extract Fe-O nanocatalyst to improve biogas production. The influence of temperature, the concentration of Sulfuric acid, and cooking time during the pretreatment to improve biogas yield was investigated. Response surface methodology of Box-Behnken Design (BBD) during the thermochemical pretreatment is employed. The biomass was pretreated at 160 degrees C temperatures, 3% concentration of sulfuric acid, and 30 min of cooking time. The highest cumulative biogas and biomethane obtained from the biomass were 764 mL/g and 460 mL/g Volatile solid. Augmentation of neem leaves extract of Iron nanocatalyst enhanced the methane gas yield with volatile solids up to 89.5%. Therefore, the use of pretreatment for the catalysis of lignocellulose substrates is advantageous for the creation of a process that is both economical and environmentally friendly.

Deployment of temperature-specific thermal hydrolysis pretreatment in anaerobic co-digestion of sewage sludge and food waste could augment the economic benefits,"Anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) is an increasingly attractive option for treating the regional organic fraction of municipal solid waste, including sewage sludge (SS) and food waste (FW). Given the differences in organic components and the effects of thermal hydrolysis pretreatment (THP) between SS and FW, this study avoids the limitations of single-temperature THP by proposing an innovative configuration of temperature-specific THP (S4: HTHP-SS + LTHP-FW). This process was compared with three other AcoD scenarios-SS + FW (S1), HTHP-SS + FW (S2), and SS + LTHP-FW (S3)-through exergy analysis and techno-economic evaluation, with the aim of improving the treatment efficiency and economic benefits of the AcoD. The results indicated that HTHP on SS and LTHP on FW respectively increased biogas recovery and waste oil extraction, making both effective strategies to improve chemical oxygen demand (COD) conversion efficiency in AcoD. Because of a high (74.5 %) COD conversion efficiency and the lower polymer consumption for sludge dewatering (a 26.7 % decrease from S1 levels), S4 yielded the maximum internal rate of return (11.18 %), shortest payback period (12.9 years), and highest net profit (19 USD/tonne-TSfed). Additionally, thermal energy balance and exergy analysis indicated that all four scenarios were thermally self-sufficient, but S4 demonstrated the highest exergy efficiency of 44.2 %. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses with Monte Carlo simulation revealed that S4 enhanced the risk resilience, resulting in an 87.7 % probability of achieving positive economic benefits, whereas S1's probability was 31.8 %. In conclusion, this study providing essential economic insight into THP deployment for SS and FW AcoD engineering, supporting the establishment and advancement of centralized systems for treating municipal solid waste.","Chen, PH; Xing, F; Li, W; Wang, EZ; Zheng, YH; Wu, XG; Li, BZ; Dong, RJ; Guo, JB",Economic analysis; Exergy analysis; Municipal solid waste; Biogas; Thermal pretreatment,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.157835,Physical,thermal,,codigestion,FW+sludge,,,,,,,,,
Investigation of thermal alkaline pretreatment of primary and waste activated sludge on the energy efficiency of sludge digestion,"Because of the naturally limited anaerobic degradability and limited biogas yield of raw sludge (RS), this study aims to increase the biogas production of primary sludge (PS) and waste activated sludge (WAS) by the integration of thermal alkaline process (TAP). PH 11 is confirmed to be the most suitable pH value for the TAP of both sludges. Moreover, with the pretreatment at pH 11 and 160 degrees C (6 bar) for 30 min, the investigated PSs and WASs achieved an increased biogas production of up to 81 % and 72 %, respectively. The improved net electricity production of WASs after TAP varied between 15-43 % compared to conventional WAS digestion.

Biogas production from food waste hydrolysate using a subcritical water pretreated process and pulp wastewater seed sludge,"This study was investigated the biogas production performance from subcritical water hydrolysate (SCWH) using a pretreated food waste (FW) process, and pulp wastewater (PW) as seed sludge according to different volatile solid (VS) ratio of PW to SCWH, and different substrate concentration. The subcritical water hydrolysis was acted for 30 mins in a 70 ml Teflon reactor under different temperatures varied from 119, 129, 139, 159, and 195 degrees C, respectively. A batch system for optimal biogas and methane production yields examination were fermented in a 60 ml flask under 37 degrees C and 120 rpm. A maximum biogas yield of 807.0 ml/g VSre and methane yield of 329.5 ml/g VSre were achieved at a VS ratio of PW to SCWH 1:3 and substrate concentration of 25 g/L with a hydrolysate under 159 degrees C and the volatile solids (VS) removal efficiency of 80%.

Effects of High Temperature & Pressure Pretreatment Process on Methane Production from Cyanobacteria,"In this study, Desertifilum tharense cyanobacteria, which has energy generation potential, was firstly isolated from the water sources from Denizli/Turkey, the culture-specific parameters were identified, characterization analyses were performed, and the production in photoreactors under laboratory conditions was performed. D. tharense cyanobacterium was subjected to a high temperature-pressure pretreatment process (HTPP) to increase methane production efficiency, and the pretreatment process was optimized for methane production. D. tharense had a total carbon (C) content of 50.2% and total organic carbon content (TOC) of 48.9%. The biochemical methane potential (BMP) of the raw D. tharense sample was measured as 261.8 mL methane (CH4) per gram of volatile solids (VS). In order to investigate the effects of HTPP and to determine the optimum process conditions, Central Composite Design (CCD) approach-based Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used. BMP values of the samples treated with HTTP were measured in the range of 201.5-235 mLCH(4) gVS(-1) and lower than the raw sample. These results revealed that the HTPP is not suitable for the production of biofuel methane from D. tharense. The optimization of the HTPP was carried out by Design Expert software. For maximum BMP production, the software proposed a reaction temperature of 200 degrees C and a reaction time of 20 min as optimum conditions. With the proposed model, it was estimated that 227.1 mLCH(4) g VS-1 methane could be produced under these conditions, and 211.4 mLCH(4) g VS-1 methane was produced in the validation experiment. It was determined that D. tharense cyanobacterium could be used as a suitable biomass source for methane production. However, it was not necessary to use the HTTP as a pretreatment process prior to the methane production.","Sahan, M; Fardinpoor, M; Yilmaz, V; Yilmaz, F; Perendeci, NA",bioenergy; biogas; biomass; microalgae; renewable energy; high temperature-pressure pretreatment,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation9030240,Physical,thermal,autoclave,micro-algae,cyanobacteria,,,,,,,,,
Pretreatment of anaerobic fermentation feedstock in a vortex layer apparatus: Effect of the working chamber ferromagnetic core on biogas production,"Currently, the volume of waste generation is growing at a high rate. Anaerobic digestion is an effective way to process organic waste to produce biogas. To increase the bioavailability and efficiency of mass transfer between feedstock particles and microorganisms, it is advisable to pretreat organic waste using various methods. One of the most promising and energy-efficient methods for preparing a feedstock for anaerobic bioconversion is its processing in a vortex layer apparatus (VLA). However, there are some limitations in the VLA operation. Therefore, to exclude the stagnant central zone from the volume of the VLA working chamber and increase the magnitude of the magnetic field in the VLA working chamber, a ferromagnetic core in the form of a steel pipe was coaxially mounted. Thus, the purpose of this work is to experimentally study the effect of the ferromagnetic core of the VLA working chamber on the production of biogas during anaerobic bioconversion of a model of organic waste from the agricultural sector. To achieve this goal, an experimental plant was developed and created. The experimental data obtained suggest the high efficiency of pretreatment of the feedstock in VLA with a ferromagnetic core in the working chamber before anaerobic bioconversion. The developed anaerobic bioconversion system made it possible to increase the methane production rate by 287 % at hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 4 days and by 3.5 times at HRT of 2 days compared to the control. At the same time, the methane yield at HRT of 4 days increased by 43 %, and at HRT of 2 days it decreased by 14 %. The hydrogen sulfide content in biogas also increased more than three times, while no hydrogen was detected in the biogas. Thus, pretreatment of the feedstock in VLA with a ferromagnetic core to produce biohythane in a one-stage anaerobic bioconversion system at 55.1 C is impractical.","Kovalev, AA; Kovalev, DA; Zhuravleva, EA; Laikova, AA; Shekhurdina, SV; Litti, Y",Hydrogen; Hydrogen -containing biogas; Hydrogen analyzer; Bio-hydrogen production; Anaerobic bioconversion; One-stage process; Ferromagnetic core; Biogas; Organic waste; Pretreatment; Vortex layer apparatus; Fermentation,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.053,Physical,mechanical desintegration,vortex layer apparatus ,ofmsw,standard,,,,,,,,,

Impact of Thermo-Mechanical Pretreatment of Sargassum muticum on Anaerobic Co-Digestion with Wheat Straw,"Sargassum muticum (SM) is an invasive macroalgal species seasonally occurring in large quantities. While generally suitable for anaerobic digestion, recent studies resulted in low specific methane yields (SMYs), presumably due to salt, polyphenol, and high fiber contents of this marine biomass. In this study, the specific biogas yield (SBY) and SMY of SM alone as well as in co-digestion with wheat straw (WS) were investigated in batch tests at process temperatures of 44 +/- 1.4 degrees C with a retention time of approx. 40 d. The pretreatment variants of SM were examined with regard to desalination and disintegration to potentially improve digestibility and to enhance the overall performance in anaerobic digestion. A sole mechanical treatment (pressing) and a thermo-mechanical treatment (heating and pressing) were tested. Batch assays showed that pressing increased the SMY by 15.1% whereas heating and pressing decreased the SMY by 15.7% compared to the untreated variant (87.64 +/- 8.72 mL/g(VS)). Both anaerobic digestion experiments generally showed that co-digestion with WS can be recommended for SM, but the observed SBY and SMY were still similar to those of other studies in which SM was not pretreated. The mechanical pretreatment of SM, however, offers the potential to enhance the SMY in the anaerobic digestion of SM with WS, but further research is necessary to identify the optimum upgrading approaches since the overall SMY of SM is relatively low compared to other substrates that are commonly used in anaerobic digestion. In addition to anaerobic digestion, SM as an already available biomass could also be of interest for further utilization approaches such as fiber production.","Huetter, M; Sailer, G; Hülsemann, B; Müller, J; Poetsch, J",brown macroalgae; marine biomass; pretreatment; biogas production; methane yield; sustainable biomass utilization,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation9090820,Physical,pressure,,algae,sargassum,,,,,,,,,

Biodegradation of willow sawdust by novel cellulase-producing bacterial consortium from wood-feeding termites for enhancing methane production,"This study was designed to develop a cellulase-producing bacterial consortium (CBC) from wood-feeding termites that could effectively degrade willow sawdust (WSD) and consequently enhance methane production. The bacterial strains Shewanella sp. SSA-1557, Bacillus cereus SSA-1558, and Pseudomonas mosselii SSA-1568 exhibited significant cellulolytic activity. Their CBC consortium showed positive effects on cellulose bioconversion, resulting in accelerated WSD degradation. After nine days of pretreatment, the WSD had lost 63%, 50%, and 28% of its cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, respectively. The hydrolysis rate of treated WSD (352 mg/g) was much higher than that of untreated WSD (15.2 mg/g). The highest biogas production (66.1 NL/kg VS) with 66% methane was observed in the anaerobic digester M-2, which contained a combination of pretreated WSD and cattle dung in a 50/50 ratio. The findings will enrich knowledge for the development of cellulolytic bacterial consortia from termite guts for biological wood pretreatment in lignocellulosic anaerobic digestion biorefineries.","Ali, SS; Jiao, HX; El-Sapagh, S; Sun, JZ",Wood waste; Anaerobic co-digestion; Biological pretreatment; Lignocellulosic biomass biogas; Cellulolytic bacteria,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2023.129232,Biological,bacterial,cellulolytic bacteria,wood,sawdust,willow,,,,,,,,
Can mild alkaline pretreatment simultaneously enhance the antioxidant capacity of Beta-carotene extracts and biomethane yields in a sustainable Dunaliella salina biorefinery?,"This research aims to assess the effect of alkaline pretreatments on the antioxidant potential of beta-carotene-rich extracts from the microalga Dunaliella salina and the cumulative biomethane production from its spent biomass, within the framework of a circular economy approach using four biorefineries. A solvent screening was performed, with ethyl acetate achieving the maximum beta-carotene extraction yield (5.3% +/- 0.03%). Alkaline pretreatments were applied to the initial biomass (direct) and extracts after a extraction with ethyl acetate (indirect), using two matrices: water (W) and a mixture water:ethanol (WE). Direct alkaline pretreatments (D) offered extracts with higher potential than indirect pretreatments (I) in terms of: i) antioxidant capacity, as measured by ABTS center dot+ assay (0.69 +/- 0.1 and 0.61 +/- 0.1 mmolTE/gDW for W-D and WE-D, respectively, and 0.55 +/- 0.1 and 0.53 +/- 0.1 mmolTE/gDW for W-I and WE-I, respectively) and center dot OH scavenging activity (1.89 +/- 0.2 and 2.05 +/- 0.5 mmolTE/gDW for W-D and WE-D, respectively, and 0.48 +/- 0 and 1.2 +/- 0.3 mmolTE/gDW for W-I and WE-I, respectively), ii) biomethane production from their spent biomass (301 +/- 14 mLCH4/gVS and 289 +/- 9.0 mLCH4/gVS for W-D and WE-D, respectively, compared to 235 +/- 57 mLCH4/gVS without alkaline pretreatment), and iii) sustainability analysis, which includes the assessment of the biomass exploitation for beta-carotene extraction and biomethane production.

Co-digestion with CM at an optimum ratio of 80:20 further increased the methane yield (738.7 mL-CH4/g-VSadded), representing a 70% improvement over pretreated HBR alone and a 137% increase compared to untreated HBR. Microbial community analysis revealed the dominance of Methanosaeta, comprising 83-93% of archaeal genera across samples. Gene expression analysis showed acetoclastic methanogenesis as the dominant pathway, accounting for 80% of methanogenesis sequences. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and CO2 reduction with H2 pathways contributed 10% each. The optimized process achieved a biodegradation efficiency of 94% for hydrothermally pretreated HBR, compared to 68% for untreated HBR. Mass balance analysis demonstrated that combining hydrothermal pretreatment with anaerobic digestion increased biogas yield from 79% for untreated HBR to 86% for pre-treated HBR (PHBR) co-digested with CM.

Effect of Pretreatment and C/N Ratio in Anaerobic Digestion on Biogas Production from Coffee Grounds and Rice Husk Mixtures,"Indonesia has great potential in producing large quantities of renewable energy sources, such as biomass. Biogas is a renewable energy source produced from biomass. It is can be developed in agricultural countries producing rice and coffee, where a large amount of waste is produced in the form of rice husks and coffee grounds. This study examined the effect of physiochemical pretreatment and the C/N ratio on biogas production using coffee grounds and rice husk mixtures. Physical pretreatment was conducted by grinding the mixture up to 50 mesh size, followed by chemical pretreatment by soaking the mixture in 3% KOH; moreover, the variation in the C/N ratio was set at 25 and 30. Anaerobic bacteria were acquired from rumen fluid. The ratio of the coffee ground material, rice husks, and rumen fluid was 1:1:1. This research was conducted in duplicate under batch conditions at ambient temperature (25-35 oC) with a digester volume of 1.5 L. Biogas productivity was measured every 2 d for 60 d. The experimental results indicated that biogas production with a C/N ratio of 30 was 13.3-66.5% higher than that with a C/N ratio of 25. The inclusion of physical pretreatment at a C/N ratio of 30 increased biogas production by up to 31.3%.

Simultaneous production of biogas and volatile fatty acids through anaerobic digestion using cereal straw as substrate,"Cereal straw is one of the most abundant wastes worldwide, with 30.000 million tons produced per year. Bioconversion of this residual material into carboxylates by anaerobic digestion could potentially replace conventional production based on fossil feedstocks (oil). In this work, fundamental issues of this bioconversion have been explored, including: different kinds of straw (wheat, barley and rye), biomass size reduction, mass balances and modeling of the different steps of the digestion. Under optimum conditions, 44% of the raw material was effectively converted into VFAs (mainly acetate) when barley was used as substrate. Wheat and rye straw presented lower conversion rates due to the higher lignin content compared to barley straw. According to the modeling proposed, methanogenesis and hydrolysis presented very similar reaction rates, which resulted in a simultaneous production of VFAs and biogas. In view of these results, a process integration is proposed where biogas covers the thermal needs of the biotransformation of barley biomass into VFAs. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

Life-cycle assessment as a prospection stage for the biochemical methane potential of pretreated lignocellulosic biomass,"The goal of neutrality in greenhouse gas emissions has intensified the search for renewable fuels. However, it is crucial to ensure sustainability of new technologies before proposing their implementation. This study proposes the use of life-cycle assessment (LCA) as an intermediary tool to identify critical hotspots in the exploration of hydrothermal pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass, followed by biochemical methane potential assessment. Brewer s spent grain (BSG) was investigated, and laboratory-scale results were applied in an attributional assessment model with business-as-usual serving as the baseline. The LCA revealed that assumptions made in the lab could pose limitations. In Brazil, the two-stage co-digestion of pretreated hydrothermal BSG showed prom-ising prospects, with a reduction to a new value of-54 kg CO2-eq Ton- 1 BSG compared to 90 kg CO2-eq Ton- 1 BSG in the business-as-usual scenario. Within the top ten global beer producing countries, only Brazil and Spain demonstrated potential for exploring this proposal.","Fernandes, ARAC; Baêta, BEL; Damgaard, A",Brewer's spent grain; Lignocellulosic biorefineries; Pretreatment; Biogas; Life-cycle assessment; LCA,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2023.129584,Physical,thermal,hydrothermal,lignocellulose,brewery spent grains,processing waste,,,,,,,,
Delignification of Halophyte Atriplex crassifolia by Green Recyclable Deep Eutectic Solvents for Enhanced Production of Biogas,"Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have upgraded the practices of valorizing lignocellulosic feedstock by lessening biomass recalcitrance through delignification in precise and economical manner. In this study, the influence of a series of deep eutectic mixtures was evaluated on the halophyte Atriplex crassifolia for achieving elevated biogas production. Initially, the biomass was pretreated via several DESs with varying hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) including carboxylic acids, amine/amide, and polyols/glycols. DES composed of choline chloride (ChCl) and lactic acid (LA) evidenced as the most effective solvent in achieving high lignin removal rates and was further optimized by evaluating the parameters of molar ratio of DES components, solid-to-liquid ratio, and solvent addition. A maximum delignification value of 89.5% was achieved by 15% diluted ChCl: LA (1:2) DES at a biomass loading of 1:15. The solubilization rate of diluted ChCl: LA was also raised up to 38%. FT-IR analysis revealed significant lignin elimination from ChCl: LA pretreated substrates. Moreover, >= 88% of ChCl: LA DES was recovered after up to three pretreatment cycles, retaining >= 85% delignification efficiency. Fresh DES-pretreated Atriplex crassifolia recorded 32.2 mL/g of biogas production yield due to increased cellulosic content. The findings validated Atriplex crassifolia as an efficient feedstock for biogas production and confirmed the affectivity of ChCl: LA pretreatment in eliminating the lignin barrier, ultimately making cellulosic sugars readily biodegradable and highly accessible for anaerobic microorganisms.","Nawaz, A; Chaudhary, R; Haq, IU; Fu, XL; Huang, R; Mukhtar, H; Jiang, KK",deep eutectic solvents; pretreatment; choline chloride; lactic acid; delignification; Atriplex crassifolia; biogas,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation9030314,Chemical,solvent,Deep eutectic solvent,lignocellulose,atriplex,plant,,,,,,,,
The Influence of the Ultrasound Disintegration of Microalgal-Bacterial Granular Sludge on Anaerobic Digestion Efficiency,"It has been proven that the biocenosis of microalgae and bacteria improves the chemical properties of biomass for its use in anaerobic digestion. However, this anaerobic digestion can be limited by the strong, compact, and complex structure of granulated biomass. Therefore, there is a need to search for an effective method for microalgal-bacterial granular sludge pretreatment, which has not been undertaken in previous scientific works. In this study, ultrasonic pretreatment was used to determine the effects of sonication on anaerobic digestion efficiency. Anaerobic digestion was performed in batch respirometric reactors. It was found that the ultrasonic pretreatment enhanced the biomass solubility; thus, the organic matter concentration increased more than six times compared to the variant without pretreatment. The study showed a positive effect of sonication on the kinetics of the anaerobic process and methane production. The highest methane yield was found in the variants in which the ultrasonication lasted from 150 s to 200 s, and this yield was from 534 & PLUSMN; 16 mL CH4/g VS to 561 & PLUSMN; 17 mL CH4/g VS. The data analysis confirmed strong correlations between the pretreatment time, the amount of biogas and methane production, and the gross energy gain. The highest net energy output and net energy gain were obtained for 150 s of sonication, and, respectively, were 4.21 & PLUSMN; 0.17 Wh/g VS and 1.19 & PLUSMN; 0.18 Wh/g VS.","Debowski, M; Kisielewska, M; Zielinski, M; Kazimierowicz, J",algal-bacterial granular sludge; ultrasonic disintegration; ultrasonic pretreatment; biogas; methane; energy gain assessment,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app13137387,Physical,ultrasonic,,micro-algae,pond,,,,,,,,,
Advancing Thermophilic Anaerobic Digestion of Corn Whole Stillage: Lignocellulose Decomposition and Microbial Community Characterization,"Converting corn grains into bioethanol is an expanding practice for sustainable fuel production, but this is accompanied by the production of large quantities of by-products such as whole stillage. In the present study, the influence of advanced wet oxidation and steam explosion (AWOEx) pretreatment on biogas production and lignocellulose decomposition of corn whole stillage (CWS) was evaluated using semi-continuous thermophilic reactors. The digestion of the CWS was shown to be feasible with an organic loading rate (OLR) of 1.12 +/- 0.03 kg VS/m3 day and a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 30 days, achieving a methane yield of 0.75 +/- 0.05 L CH4/g VSfed for untreated stillage and 0.86 +/- 0.04 L CH4/g VSfed for pretreated stillage, corresponding with an increase in methane yield of about 15%. However, the reactors showed unstable performance with the highest investigated OLRs and shortest HRTs. Under optimal conditions, the conversion efficiencies of COD, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin were 88, 95, 97, and 59% for pretreated CWS, and 86, 94, 95, and 51% for untreated CWS, respectively. Microbial community analysis showed that Proteiniphilum, MBA03, and Acetomicrobium were the dominant genera in the digestate and were likely responsible for the conversion of proteins and volatile fatty acids in CWS.","Bokhary, A; Enriquez, FA; Garrison, R; Ahring, BK",wet oxidation and steam explosion; hydraulic retention time; hemicellulose; volatile fatty acids; biogas; pretreatment,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation10060306,Physical,thermal,awoex,lignocellulose,corn,stillage,,,,,,,,
Calcium hypochlorite assisted energetically efficient sonic hydrolysis of waste activated sludge for cost effective biogas production,"The extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in waste activated sludge (WAS) act as a protective barrier and limits the disintegration potential of the pretreatment process. In this study, an attempt was made to improve the disintegration potential of the pretreatment process by phase separating it into deflocculation and disintegration. In deflocculation, Calcium hypochlorite (Ca(ClO)(2)) was used to remove EPS, and in disintegration, ultrasonication was used to solubilize the WAS. An effective deflocculation was achieved at an optimum Ca(ClO)(2) dosage of 0.02 g/g SS and a time of 15 min. The results of calcium hypochlorite-induced ultrasonication (CH-UP) revealed a substantial enhancement in suspended solids (SS) reduction, with a remarkable 18.42 % reduction compared to 11.57 % of ultrasonic pretreatment (UP). Additionally, the biodegradability of the sludge was evaluated using the biochemical methane potential test. The results showcased a notable increase in methane production, with CH-UP exhibiting a methane yield of 92.5 mL/g COD, compared to 68.2 mL/g COD for UP alone.

Effect of potassium persulphate-induced microwave pretreatment for cost-effective sludge solubilization and bioenergy recovery,"The disintegration of municipal waste activated sludge (MWAS) by energy-intensive physical pretreatments is considered expensive. In the present study, an effort was undertaken to disintegrate the sludge by microwave assisted pretreatment (MAP) in an energy-efficient and economical way by combining the microwave with oxidant potassium persulphate. Besides, the sulphate radicals generated through activated persulfate can efficiently disintegrate and solubilize sludge. In this context, microwave pretreatment was combined with potassium persulfate to activate the generation of sulphate radicals for economically enhanced sludge solubilization. MAP was done by varying the microwave power levels (10 to 50 %) and pretreatment time (0 to 30 min). Microwave assisted potassium persulphate pretreatment (MAPPP) was done by varying the potassium per sulphate dosage (0.005 to 0.04 g/g Total solids (TS) and pretreatment time (0 to 14 min). Combining microwave with potassium persulfate brings about a synergistic effect, generating sulphate and hydroxyl radicals that can effectively disintegrate and solubilize biopolymers of sludge. A higher sludge lysis rate of 37.25 % was achieved by this microwave assisted potassium persulfate pretreatment (MAPPP) when compared to microwave assisted pretreatment (MAP) alone (26.27 % after thickening). A higher methane yield of 219.14 mL/g Volatile solids (VS) was obtained through MAPPP compared to MAP (154.22 mL/g VS). The detailed mass, energy, and economic assessment at a large-scale level for MAP and MAPPP revealed that MAPPP was energetically and economically feasible with an energy ratio of 1.22 and net profit of 42.03 USD/Ton compared to MAP.

Non-ionic surfactant integrated ultrasonic pretreatment on food waste for biomethane production: Process optimization and its impact on solubilization,"Food waste (FW) can be a suitable substrate for generating biofuels such as biomethane. The complex polymer structure in FW reduces its biodegradability during anaerobic digestion (AD). Therefore, pretreatment of FW prior to AD helps to disintegrate the complex structure and thus makes the organic matter readily available to AD's hydrolytic enzymes. The present work focused on the optimization of process parameters to improve the solubilization of organic matter (SOM) and thereby enhance the biomethane yield from food waste (FW) using Ultrasonic coupled non-ionic surfactant (Alkyl poly glycoside, APG) pretreatment (USCSP). Initially, the effect of ultrasonic pretreatment (USP) was optimized using response surface methodology (central composite design), and then, under optimized USP conditions, USCSP was performed and optimized. Optimal results showed that SOM of 16.4 % was achieved at 159.0 W, 15.0 mins under USP. Moreover, USCSP reduces the pretreatment time to 6.6 mins and increases the SOM by 21.7 %. In addition, a 46.8 % reduction in specific energy input (EISp) can be achieved in USCSP compared to USP. This increment in SOM and decrease in EISp were due to the synergetic effect of APG over USP. The high R2 values of 0.988 and 0.984 for USP and USCSP revealed that the models applied effectively for the SOM of FW.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to study the effects of pretreatment on microstructural arrangements, and the pretreated substrate was digested at mesophilic temperature to determine its biomethane potential. The result of SEM analysis indicated that DES pretreatment alters the microstructural arrangement of groundnut shells, and XRD analysis showed an optimum crystallinity index of 20.71% when the substrate with a solid:liquid ratio of 1:2 was experimented at 80 degrees C. The highest theoretical biomethane yield of 486.81 mL CH4/gVSadded was recorded when the substrate with a 1:4 solid:liquid ratio was investigated at 100 degrees C, and the highest biodegradability rate (84.87%) was observed from the substrate treated with a 1:2 solid:liquid ratio at 100 degrees C. The optimum biomethane yield of 365.70 mL CH4/gVSadded, representing a 226.05% increase, was observed from 1:2 of solid:liquid ratios at 100 degrees C.

Effect of bacterial pretreatment on solid sago waste for enhanced biomethane generation,"The sago processing industry was considered to be one of the major sources of revenue in some countries. During processing, an enormous amount of carbohydrate rich waste is generated, thus making it a feasible substrate for bioenergy production. Despite its nutrient content, the complex structure of this substrate restricts the hydrolysis phase during anaerobic digestion. In this study, an investigation was made to augment the hydrolysis of sago waste by enzyme-secreting bacterial pretreatment. At 42 h, the solubilization enhanced to 10.4 % in SBN (a medium consisting of sago and nutrient inoculated with bacteria) as compared to the SB (a medium containing sago inoculated with bacteria) (4.2 %). After pretreatment, the biomethane potential assay shows that the methane generation was boosted to 28.1 mL/gCOD in the SBN sample compared to SB (11.9 mL/gCOD) and raw sago sample (3.2 mL/gCOD). The higher biomass solubilization enables easier accessibility of substrate for methane production.","Sudharsh, S; Lavanya, V; Preethi; Gondi, R; Roy, CL; Kannan, M; Banu, JR",Hydrolysis; Solubilization; Biomethane; Pretreatment; Nutrient,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biteb.2024.101774,Biological,bacterial,bacillus,food waste,sago,waste,,,,,,,,

In codigestion tests, the aerial part of water hyacinth resulted in the highest methane production of 159 NmL.gVS-1 at 25% poultry waste followed by the whole water hyacinth at 25% poultry waste with 147.73 NmL.gVS-1. The aerial part and the whole water hyacinth mixed with cow manure at 60:40 registered 120 and 114.47 NmL.gVS-1, respectively. Alkali-thermal pretreatment using (KOH at 50 degrees C for 5 h) at different concentrations of 1.5, 2 and 3% showed that 1.5% recorded the highest methane production. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the (1.5% KOH, 50 degrees C, 5 h) pretreatment in improving mixtures solubilization, biodegradability, and methane production compared to the untreated ones. Alkali-thermal pretreatment reduces retention times compared to the untreated water hyacinth. The shortest retention time has been achieved for pretreated aerial part of water hyacinth at 25% poultry waste (8 days) and at 40% cow manure mixture (9 days) compared to the longest retention time of the whole untreated water hyacinth at 40% cow manure mixture (26 days). The gas chromatography (GC) analysis of biogas revealed that the highest percentage of CH4 (80%) was found for the whole pretreated water hyacinth at 25% poultry waste, followed by the untreated aerial part of water hyacinth at 25% poultry waste (60%). The application of the pretreatment method increased the concentration of calcium in the liquid digestate, making it more beneficial for soil use. The solid fraction, which comprises less than 10% of the digestate, exhibited a high phosphorus content compared to the liquid fraction. The use of Alkali-thermal pretreatment led to an increase in assimilable (P2O5) levels, and a significant reduction in the concentrations of Zn and Cu heavy metals in all pretreated mixtures. The levels of iron, zinc, and copper in the liquid digestate were within the acceptable range for soil fertilizer application in both untreated and pretreated mixtures. This work presents a novel technique for producing methane and appropriate digestate for soil application from water hyacinth, highlighting the potential for further research in this area.","Karouach, F; Ben Bakrim, W; Ezzariai, A; Mnaouer, I; Ibourki, M; Kibret, M; Sobeh, M; Hafidi, M; Kouisni, L",Biomethane; Biofertilizer; Pretreatment; Codigestion; Manure; Water Hyacinth,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2023.130008,Chemical,alkaline,KOH,lignocellulose,water hyacinth,plant,,,,,,,,

Enhancing microstructural and biomethane yield of Xyris capensis using combined oxidative and nanoparticle additive pretreatment methods,"Renewable energy production from lignocellulose materials is a significant interest of modern research because it can assist in reducing the global challenges of climate preservation and energy demand. Lignocellulose materials are recalcitrant and are not easy to digest during anaerobic digestion, and this necessitated their pretreatment before anaerobic digestion for effective and efficient use of the feedstock. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of oxidative, nanoparticle additive, and combined pretreatment on the microstructural arrangement and biomethane yield of Xyris capensis, an economical feedstock that is readily available. Xyris capensis was pretreated with the oxidizing agent at varying conditions of H2O2: H2SO4 using 100: 0%, 95: 5%, 85: 15%, and 75: 25%. The effects of the pretreatment on the microstructure, crystallinity, and functional groups of the substrate were investigated. Pretreated and untreated substrates were digested as mono pretreatment and in combination with 20 mg/L Fe3O4 (< 50 nm) nanoparticles at mesophilic temperature to study the influence of pretreatment on biomethane yield. Results from structural analyses showed that the pretreatment conditions have a varying degree of effect on the microstructural arrangement. The optimum biomethane yield of 212.18 mL CH4/gVS(added), representing 48% improvement, was recorded for a single pretreatment. For the combined pretreatment method, the highest biomethane yield of 278.59 mL CH4/gVS(added), which represents a 95% increase, was observed. Therefore, combined oxidative pretreatment and Fe3O4 nanoparticle additive could be a promising approach to debase the recalcitrant properties of lignocellulose feedstock microstructure to enhance the biomethane yield. This technique can improve energy recovery from lignocellulose materials, assist in decarbonization of the environment, and can be examined on a commercial scale.","Olatunji, KO; Madyira, DM",Renewable energy; Biomethane; Lignocellulose feedstock; Xyris capensis; Pretreatment; Microstructure,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13399-023-04401-8,Chemical,oxidation,H2O2,lignocellulose,Xyris,grass,,,,,,,,
"Integrated poultry waste management by co-digestion with perennial grass: Effects of mixing ratio, pretreatments, reaction temperature, and effluent recycle on biomethanation yield","This work aims to enhance the efficiency of integrated poultry waste management in bio-circular-green economy by maximizing the co-digestion of chicken manure and its digestate-grown biomass. In a series of batch assays, Napier grass (NG) was mixed with chicken manure (CM) at various proportions (100:0, 80:20, 60:40, 50:50, 40:60, 20:80 and 0:100) to identify co-substrate synergism, followed by physiochemical conditioning (size reduction and ultrasonication) of NG before co-digestion. Results indicated that NG mix of at least 80% was required to gain a full methanation potential of the individual substrates; no synergistic ratio above unity was found. However, the combined effect of size reduction and sonication was found to markedly improve the cosubstrate's biodegradability by 88.7%. The findings were then used to run continuous co-digestion at various operating regimes. In optimal continuous co-digestion condition, NG particle size of 0.6-2.4 mm combined with sonication intensity at 1111 kJ/kgTS improved biomethanation yield as high as 106.3%. Sub-thermophilic digestion at 45 degrees C was shown to give a higher and more stable CH4 yield than at 55 degrees C. Finally, it was also found that recycling liquid effluent at 40% to replace freshwater in feed, although showed no significant difference in CH4 yield (& alpha; = 0.05), noticeably increased system buffer capacity. This optimized biodegradation regime could give co-digestion waste management a higher overall plant efficiency and economic return.","Phuttaro, C; Krishnan, S; Saritpongteeraka, K; Charnnok, B; Diels, L; Chaiprapat, S",Poultry waste; Napier grass; Size reduction; Ultrasonic pretreatment; Synergistic ratio; Biomethane production,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2023.108937,Physical,mechanical desintegration,,lignocellulose,napier grass,grass,,,,,,,,

Effect of ozonation on biodegradability enhancement and biomethanation potential of pretreatment process wastewaters from 2G ethanol production,"BACKGROUND The production of second-generation (2G) ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass generates large quantities of high-strength complex wastewaters from various stages of the process. An effective pretreatment is necessary in order to overcome the low biodegradability of these wastewaters for further biomethane recovery. The present study reports the effect of ozonation on the biodegradability enhancement and biomethanation potential of complex 2G ethanol pretreatment process wastewaters, from acid (H2SO4) and alkali (NaOH) pretreatment process. RESULTS Ozonation (9.33 g m(-3)) was performed for both acid and alkali pretreatment wastewaters at a flow rate of 10 L min(-1) for 1 h. Ozonation of both wastewaters increased biodegradability index (BI) up to 36% along with minimal chemical oxygen demand (COD; 7 +/- 3%), color (10 +/- 4%), and toxicity (22.5 +/- 7.5%) reduction. Biomethane potential tests were carried out for the control and ozonated wastewaters having BI > 0.4. The acid-pretreatment wastewater indicated poor biomethanation potential due to high presence of sulfates (COD/SO4 similar to 3.0). However, ozonation of alkali-pretreatment wastewater facilitated up to twofold enhancement in the cumulative methane volume, while the enhancement in the rate of methane production was found to be up to 47%. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis of control and ozonated wastewaters revealed the breakdown of complex organic molecules and aromatics to readily biodegradable intermediates. The kinetics of methane generation could be predicted by the modified Gompertz model. CONCLUSION The study demonstrated the efficacy of ozonation as an effective pretreatment option to facilitate biodegradability enhancement of 2G ethanol pretreatment process wastewaters. The enhancement in biodegradability was observed to enable subsequent biogas recovery via anaerobic digestion along with COD removal.
